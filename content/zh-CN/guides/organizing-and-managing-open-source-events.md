标题: 组织与管理开源活动
---

Open source events are popular as much for the networking opportunities as for the skill building exercises and knowledge sharing. Events run the gamut from single focused internal talks and multitrack corporate external events to the international conferences. While decades of experience shape these events, today a global pandemic is driving a hard shift from physical to virtual venues. The change is likely permanent as virtual venues are unlikely to disappear once the novel coronavirus is curtailed or conquered. There are already hints that the future will see a rise of hybrid versions.

开源活动之所以受欢迎，不仅仅是因为它们提供了技能提升和知识分享的机会，还因为它们提供了良好的社交机会。活动的形式多种多样，从单一的内部讲座和多主题的公司外部活动到国际会议。尽管这些活动在几十年的经验中不断完善，但如今全球疫情正在推动活动从线下场所向线上场所的重大转变。这种变化可能是永久性的，因为一旦新冠病毒得到控制或被消除，线上会场也不太可能消失。已经有迹象表明，未来将会出现更多混合形式的活动。

Behind all of these events is an OSPO or small events team managing the details, gathering speakers and volunteers, promoting the benefits, and calling open source fans to attend. Those responsible are invisible when all goes right and wishing they were if things go wrong. In short, event management can be a thankless job. Through it all, they make everything happen no matter what minor glitches or major pandemics might plague them along the way.

在所有这些活动的背后，都有一个OSPO或一个小型活动团队在管理细节、召集演讲者和志愿者、宣传活动的好处，并呼吁开源爱好者参加。当一切顺利时，这些负责人是隐身幕后的，而如果出了问题，他们也会希望自己也是隐形的。总之，活动管理可能是一项吃力不讨好的工作。尽管如此，无论遇到小问题还是大疫情，他们都会让一切顺利进行。

The purpose of this guide is to help OSPOs and open source event team members pull off successful open source events through the sharing of experience and resources of those who have done so before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. This guide is meant to be a living document in that it is expected to be updated as the challenges of this time continue to unfold new obstacles and opportunities for event managers.

本指南的目的是通过分享那些在新冠疫情前和疫情期间成功举办开源活动的经验和资源，帮助OSPO和开源活动团队成员顺利举办开源活动。由于当前的挑战不断带来新的障碍和机遇，本指南预计将不断更新，因此它是一个动态文档。

## Intro

## 开源活动介绍

Open source events are educational and networking hubs for the benefit of specific or at-large open source communities. Whether intimate or gigantic, these events are essential to the growth of the open source movement, of individual careers and professional reputations, and the growth of specific open source projects.

开源活动是特定或大型开源社区的教育和交流中心。无论规模大小，这些活动对于开源运动的发展、个人职业生涯和行业声誉的提升，以及特定开源项目的增长都至关重要。

It is easy to think of open source events as similar to planning, organizing and promoting other technology events. While there are some similarities overall, open source events are in a category of their own.  

人们很容易认为开源活动与规划、组织和推广其他技术活动类似。虽然总体上有一些相似之处，但开源活动实际上自成一类。

> "Honestly, there are a lot of differences. A traditional tech event is more about strategic alliances and partnerships and how can you help me and how can I help you, but all for more of a capitalistic purpose, as it were," – Angela Brown, senior vice president and General Manager of Events at [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

> “坦白说，有很多不同之处。传统的技术活动更多的是关于战略联盟和合作关系，以及你如何帮我、我如何帮你，但所有这些更多的是出于资本的目的。” —— [Linux基金会](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)高级副总裁兼活动总经理Angela Brown。

*"By its very nature, the open-source community is deeply passionate about what they do, and very passionate about open-source. That passion extends into everything,"* - added Brown, who has worked on tech events for other companies since 1994. She joined the Linux Foundation in 2007 after the organization arose from the merger of the previous open-source Development Labs and Free Standards Group. Linux Foundation events began to take shape almost immediately.

*“就其本质而言，开源社区对他们所做的事情，以及对开源本身，都充满热情。这种热情延伸到方方面面，”* - Brown补充到。自1994年以来，她一直在其他公司参与技术活动工作。2007年，她加入了由之前的开源开发实验室和自由标准组织合并而成的Linux基金会。Linux基金会的活动很快就开始成形。

The good news is there is a long laundry list of event management skills that are easily transferable from tech events to open source events. However, failing to keep key differences in mind can set your event up for failure from the start.

好消息是，有一长串的活动管理技能可以很容易地从技术活动转移到开源活动。然而，如果没有牢记关键的差异，你的活动可能从一开始就注定失败。

*"When you realize what those motivations are, it does infer and change how you are actually going to create an event,"* - Brown explained.

*“当你意识到这些动机是什么时，就会推断出并改变你实际创建活动的方式，”* - Brown解释说。

Those motivation differences also create some interesting, and often misunderstood conference feedback.

这些动机之间的差异也会产生一些有趣和经常被误解的会议反馈。

For one thing, open source programmers are passionate so they are quick to approach organizers at conferences to report what’s wrong or what could be improved. These encounters can sound like harsh judgments and complaints, but they usually are not.

一方面，开源程序员充满热情，因此他们会在会议上迅速找到组织者，报告哪些地方出了问题，哪些地方可以改进。这些交流听起来像是苛刻的批评或抱怨，但通常并非如此。

*"It’s what they do: find bugs and fix them. That's how we can iterate and make events better. It doesn't mean that people don't actually enjoy the events, but it definitely was funny. I had a hard time with that at the beginning,"* - laughs Brown.

*“他们的工作就是发现错误并修复它们。这样我们才能不断改进，把活动做得更好。这并不意味着人们不喜欢这些活动，但这确实很有趣。一开始我很难接受这一点，”* Brown笑着说。

There are marked differences in OSPO and event teams charged with supporting open source as well. Team history, skill sets, and aims and goals can vary widely.

负责支持开源的OSPO和活动团队之间也存在明显差异。团队历史、技能情况、目标和使命可能大相径庭。

Most open source event organizers have funny tales and war stories to share. But not all of them came to the task by the same path. Some, like the Salesforce team, picked up the responsibility just before a pandemic locked them down.

大多数开源活动的组织者都会分享趣事和血泪史。但不是所有人都会以相同的方式完成任务。有些人，例如Saleforce团队，是在疫情将他们困住之前承担起这一责任的。

*"In the world of open source we want to make sure people know we’re just starting to dip our toes into these events that are very specific to open source, but we have done quite a few,"* - said Alyssa Arvin who worked in engineering marketing at Salesforce for seven years before moving to [its OSPO](https://opensource.salesforce.com/) in December – roughly a month before the novel coronavirus went viral on a pandemic scale.

*“在开源世界中，我们希望让人们知道我们刚刚开始涉足这些专门针对开源的活动，但我们已经做了相当多的工作，”* - Alyssa Arvin说。她在Salesforce公司的工程营销部门工作了7年，然后在12月份调任到了[该公司的OSPO](https://opensource.salesforce.com/)——大约在新冠疫情全球爆发前的一个月。

## Open source event types

## 开源活动类型

There are four general categories for open source events. The first two are determined by venue: physical or virtual. The remaining two are determined by audience: internal (company employees and partners) or external (open to people employed outside of the event organizer).

开源活动一般分为四类。前两类由场地决定：线上或线下。其余两类由受众决定：内部（公司员工和合作伙伴）或外部（对活动组织者以外的人员开放）。

Event types can also be categorized by purpose or goal.

活动类型也可以用活动目的或目标来区分。

> "There are events that we're doing to cultivate a community internally. There are events that we're trying to do to appreciate the external communities that we rely on. And then there are the events that we're doing to support the Open Source Projects that come out of Salesforce" – Joshua Simmons, formerly a senior strategist in Salesforce’s OSPO.

> “我们举办的活动有的是为了在内部培养社区，有的是为了感谢我们依赖的外部社区，还有的是为了支持Salesforce推出的开源项目，”前Salesforce OSPO高级策略师Joshua Simmons说。
 
Many organizations have experience in conducting open source events in physical venues, whether those are onsite or off, or for an internal or external audience.

许多组织都有在线下场所举办开源活动的经验，无论在内部或外部场所，或者针对内部或外部受众。

> "The process is pretty similar for internal and external events, other than the marketing piece," – Shilla Saebi, Open Source Program Manager at [Comcast](https://comcast.github.io/).

> “除了营销部分，内部和外部活动的流程非常相似，” - [Comcast公司](https://comcast.github.io/)开源项目经理Shilla Saebi说。

However, virtual events are significantly different and completely new to many organizations who soon discovered they would need to learn how on the fly.

然而，线上活动与此大相径庭，对许多组织来说是全新的经历，他们很快就会发现自己需要快速学习如何开展线上活动。

> "Physical events and virtual events have different advantages and limitations. Physical events can create an in-person emotional experience but not everyone in the world is able to attend due to location or related travel cost. On the other hand, virtual events are scalable. They have an easy entry point," – Teresa Terasaki, Brand Experience & Events and Program Manager, Open Source Community at [Google Open Source].

> “线下和线上活动各有优势和局限。线下活动可以带来亲临现场的情感体验，但考虑到地理位置或相关旅行成本，并不是世界上每个人都能参加。另一方面，线上活动具有可扩展性。参与门槛低，” – [Google开源社区](https://opensource.google/)品牌体验与活动和项目经理Teresa Terasaki说。

Among the main advantages to a physical event are the social interactions, networking opportunities and a new environment in which to spur innovation and collaboration with others. These happen to also be the greatest weaknesses in virtual events.

线下活动的主要优势包括社交互动、建立人脉的机会，以及激发创新和与他人合作的新环境。这些恰好也是线上活动的最大弱点。

Among the main advantages of a virtual event are increased safety during a pandemic, scalability, affordability, accessibility, and no travel or other associated costs. But virtual events have downsides too.

线上活动的主要优势包括：疫情期间安全性更高、可扩展性、经济性、可访问性，以及无需差旅或其他相关开支。但线上活动也有缺点。

> "In recent months, we’ve seen a significant increase in participation at virtual events. Virtual events are able to reach new geographies and enable people who wouldn’t normally be able to join to attend traditional, in-person events. But they aren’t able to provide intensive in-person experience like physical events do," – María Cruz, Program Manager, Community Engagement at [Google](https://opensource.google/).

> “最近几个月，我们看到参与线上活动的人数大幅增加。线上活动能够覆盖新的地域，让通常无法参加传统现场活动的人有机会参与。但线上活动无法像线下活动那样提供深度现场体验，” - [Google](https://opensource.google/)社区参与项目经理María Cruz说。
 
Beyond these general categories, are myriad subcategories of event types. Most are determined by topic, but others are categorized by time or intensity.

除了这些常见开源活动类别之外，还有无数的活动类型子类别。主要通过活动主题区分，也有通过举办时长和活动密集度来进行区分。

*"Events like sprints for projects come to mind. For example, sprints on the Python language orbit around every Python conference. They hold several days of sprints, both for people who are core to the project to make headway while they have the good fortune of being in the same physical space with each other. But also, as an onramp to new contributors,"* said Josh Simmons, former open source strategist for [Salesforce](https://opensource.salesforce.com/). He also previously served as President of Salesforce’s Open Source Initiative.

*“我想到那些作为开源项目冲刺的开源活动。例如，每次Python会议都会围绕Python语言开展冲刺活动。他们会举行为期数天的冲刺活动，既让项目的核心成员取得进展，又让他们有幸在同一个物理空间中彼此交流，也为新贡献者提供入门的途径，”* 前[Salesforce](https://opensource.salesforce.com/)开源策略师Josh Simmons说。他之前还担任过Salesforce开源计划主席。

*"Sprints are going to be an important one to look into at some point. You might want to make sure it's on your radar."*

*“冲刺将是你在某个时刻需要关注的重要事项。你可能需要确保它在你的视野范围内。”*

Regardless of the type of open source event you’re currently planning, virtual will reign supreme in venues for as long as the pandemic lasts and will probably remain a strong option afterwards. While most organizations are learning how to host a virtual event on the fly, shared experiences are beginning to reveal some good guidance.

无论你目前正在筹划哪种类型的开源活动，只要疫情持续，线上活动将在场地选择上占据主导地位，并且在疫情结束后可能仍然是一个强有力的选择。虽然大多数组织正在快速学习如何举办线上活动，但共享的经验已经开始揭示一些有用的指导。

## 4 key elements in virtual open source events

## 线上开源活动的四个关键元素

Pivoting to virtual open source events is a smart and natural move during the Covid-19 pandemic. But that is not to say it was an easy move to make.

在新冠疫情期间转向开源活动是一个明智而自然的举措。但这并不是说这是一件容易的事情。

*"First we had to negotiate out of all of the contracts we had this year. It was a lot to contend with because if a local government bans large gatherings, for example, then you've got force majeure in your favor. But just being in a pandemic doesn't free you from the contract,"* said Brown.

*“首先，我们必须通过谈判解除今年的所有合同。这涉及很多棘手的工作，因为如果当地政府禁止大型集会，那么不可抗力就会对你有利。但是，仅仅因为处于新冠疫情之中，则并不能让你免于履行合同，”* Brown说到。

*"It quickly then became necessary to research virtual event platforms and try to figure out which ones really meet our needs. But perhaps the biggest challenge was in rolling those out and trying to create the same type of attendee experience as in physical events, which to be quite honest, you can't create the same thing. Right? So, you move on to planning an entirely new and hopefully just as engaging experience,"* Brown added.

*“很快，我们就必须开始研究线上活动平台，并试图找出哪些平台能真正满足我们的需求。但可能最大的挑战在于推出这些线上活动，并试图创造与线下活动相同的参与体验。坦白说，你无法创造出完全相同的体验，对吧？所以，你需要转而规划一种全新的、希望同样吸引人的体验，”* Brown补充到。

But the stress endured by teams scrambling to make virtual work is not for naught.

但是，争分夺秒组织线上开源活动的团队所承受的压力并非毫无意义。

*"This is an opportunity to think outside the box including platform, format, content, timing, and interactivity. We can also reach audience groups that you don’t normally reach at in-person events,"* said Terasaki.

*“这是一个跳出固有框架来思考的机会，包括平台、形式、内容、时机以及互动性。我们还可以接触到通常在现场活动中接触不到的受众群体，”* - Terasaki说。

Teams should get comfortable with planning open source events as they’re likely to still be in use far after the pandemic rush subsides. However, virtual events are also likely to evolve.

各团队应熟练掌握开源活动规划技能，因为疫情消退后这些技能很可能仍在使用。不过，线上活动也有可能不断发展。

*"Considering the level of innovation in accessibility for remote participation, and the positive impact it has on the event’s reach, there is a chance that events transform to a hybrid format. This would imply that an event can both be in-person and virtual: while some participants will gather in the same venue, there could be a portion of the speakers presenting virtually, with some attendees joining remotely as well,"* said Cruz.

*“考虑到远程参与的无障碍创新水平及其对活动影响力的积极影响，未来的开源活动有可能转变为混合模式。这意味着一场活动可以线下、线上同时进行：虽然一些参会者将聚集在同一地点，但部分演讲者可能在线上演讲，同时也有部分参会者远程参加，”* Cruz说。

**Event focus**

**开源活动聚焦点**

Deciding the focus of your event is the first and most important step as it sets the scale, tone, and pace for the rest of the event planning.

确定活动的目的是第一步，也是最重要的一步，因为它决定了活动规模、氛围，以及活动后续规划的节奏。

*"First, figure out what your purpose is and why you are gathering people together. Who are you looking to gather together, and how do dates and timing work for that group? There are so many events out there, or there have been so many events out there already. How is yours different and why would people want to attend? These are questions to ask yourself and team,"* says Brown.

*“首先，弄清楚你的目标是什么，以及为什么要把人们聚集在一起。你希望召集哪些人，日期和时间如何安排？正在举办或者已举办的活动数不胜数。你的活动有什么不同之处，为什么人们想要参加？这些都是要问自己和团队的问题，”* Brown说。

In short, make sure you’re bringing an event with value to a group that will value the information.

简而言之，请确保你要举办的活动能为重视这些信息的群体带来价值。

Once you know the purpose and the intended audience, you’ll be able to quickly determine other parameters, such as the type of virtual venue technologies you will need.

一旦确定了目的和预期受众，你就能迅速确定其他决定因素，如所需的线上会场技术类型。

**Funding: registration fees and sponsorships**

**活动经费：报名费和赞助费**

Registration and sponsorship fees are typical funding sources for physical open source events, but these may be harder to muster for virtual events. Traditionally, open source events fare better if registration fees are low as that tends to bring in larger attendance numbers. Sponsorships cover many if not all of the costs at many events, or at least any shortfall from lowering the registration fees.

报名费和赞助费是线下开源活动一贯的经费来源，但对于线上活动来说，这类费用可能会更难筹集。按照以往经验来看，如果注册费较低，开源活动的参与人数通常会更多，活动就会进展得更加顺利。在许多活动中，赞助费即使不能覆盖全部成本也能覆盖大部分成本，或者至少能够弥补因降低报名费而造成的资金缺口。

While many organizers are not seeking to profit from an event, most would like to cover their costs if for no other reason than to offer more events to the community.

虽然许多组织者并不期望从活动中获利，但如果不是为了向社区提供更多的活动，大多数组织者都希望能够收回成本。

*"A lot of that comes down to why a sponsor would sponsor that event in the first place. That varies. For some events like Linux Kernel Summit, for example, which is annual meeting of 80 to 90 people, where the Linux story evolves, and the core kernel developers sit down and decide what's going to happen with future release cycles. Sponsors pay good money to get a seat at the table at that event. That is really the only benefit they care about,"* says Brown.

*“这在很大程度上取决于赞助商究竟为什么要赞助这项活动。这因情况而异。例如，Linux 内核峰会（Linux Kernel Summit）是有 80 到 90 人参加的年度会议，Linux 的故事在这里不断发展，核心的内核开发人员坐在一起决定未来发布周期的内容。赞助商花大价钱就能在会上获得一席之地。这实际上是他们唯一关心的好处，”* Brown说。

*"Whereas another event like Linux Plumbers Conference attracts developers who are working in all of the core subsystems of the Linux kernel, that so many companies and organizations depend on. A lot of companies sponsor that event, not because of the individual benefits that they find in a sponsorship perspective, but simply because they know it is important to support the community. It benefits everybody. But then you have other events like KubeCon, where it is a lead gen thing,"* Brown added.

*“而像Linux Plumbers Conference这样的活动则吸引了在Linux内核所有核心子系统中工作的开发者，许多公司和机构都依赖于这些开发者。很多公司赞助这个活动，不是出于从赞助中获得个体好处，而仅仅是因为他们知道支持社区的重要性。这对每个人都有好处。但是还有像KubeCon这样的其他活动，那里是一个培育潜在客户的场所，”* Brown补充到。

Virtual events incur costs too and organizers must decide whether to pay them or seek funding elsewhere. Consider that given the long dry spell in open source events and conferences, there is pent up demand now among sponsors and open source recruiters who are effectively cut off from much of the open source community. Finding a way to involve sponsors in virtual events helps restore the full circle of open source relationships.

线上活动同样会产生成本，组织者必须决定是自行承担成本，还是从别处寻求资金支持。考虑到开源活动和会议经历了长时间的空白期，现在赞助商和开源招聘人员之间存在着被压抑的需求，他们实际上与开源社区的大部分隔绝了。找到一种让赞助商参与到线上活动的方法，有助于恢复开源协作关系的正常运转。

**Code of conduct**

**行为准则**

It comes as no surprise to anyone that a code of conduct is just as imperative for online behavior as it is in real world events. However, your current standby code of conduct may need some revamping to ensure all the virtual bases are covered. Be sure to comb through it carefully before deeming it the official rule of the venue.

人们对于线上活动的行为准则和现实世界活动一样重要不会感到奇怪。然而，为确保覆盖所有的线上活动基础事项，你现有的待实施行为准则可能需要一些修订。在确认它成为活动场所的正式行为准则前，请务必仔细梳理。

*"It's not just about having the code of conduct, it's about knowing how to actually execute on it,"* said Brown.

*“不仅要有行为准则，还要知道如何真正执行它们，”* Brown说。

**Diversity**

**多元化**

Diversity outreach is important in efforts aimed at building broader interest and participation in open source and open source projects, and to increase event attendance.

多元化外联很重要，可以建立对开源和开源项目更广泛的兴趣和参与度，并提高活动出席率。

*"Tech has a representation problem, period. And Open Source requires someone to have volunteer time, basically to contribute. That is sort of the proxy for privilege. So we end up with Open Source having an even bigger diversity in representation problem than tech itself does,"* Simmons said.

*“科技领域存在代表性问题，这是事实。而开源要求有人有时间自愿贡献，这实际上是特权的一种体现。因此，开源在代表性的多元化方面的问题比科技领域本身的问题还要严重，”* Simmons说。

*"We have to do a lot to intentionally overcome that. We proactively look for speakers with name recognition but also if the speaker can be a woman, great. If it can be person of color, all the better. If they can be a gender minority, fantastic. We're trying to both tap into people with name recognition as well as people who can be role models,"* added Simmons.

*“我们必须付出很多努力来有意地克服这一点。我们会积极寻找具有知名度的演讲者，但如果演讲者是女性，那非常好。如果是有色人种，就更好了。如果是性别少数群体，那就太棒了。我们在努力吸引知名人士以及可以成为榜样的人物，”* Simmons补充到。

## Finding a theme or event focus

## 找到开源活动主题或目的

The first step is to determine the theme or focus of the event as that will guide everything that follows in event planning.

第一步是确定活动的主题或目的，因为这将指导活动策划的后续所有工作。

*"At the core, you have to decide what the purpose is of the event and who you plan on being there. That will in turn define where the event should be, what kind of venue it should be in, what the setup should be, and how you are going to market it,"* said Brown.

*“核心在于你必须决定活动的目的是什么，以及你计划邀请哪些人。这将反过来决定活动地点、场地类型、布置方式以及营销方式，”* Brown说。

Theme and expected attendee size affect the event’s setting and tone. There are events where the purpose is to include and attract more people. Conversely, there are some events where the headcount does not matter, for example, a hackfest or a technical forum. *"At that point, it is really about creating an environment where people can come and all they have to focus on is getting the work done that they came to accomplish with other people. And hopefully having a good time while they are doing it,"* Brown added.

主题和预期参会人数会影响活动的环境和氛围。有些活动的目的是吸引更多的人参加。相反，也有一些活动人数并不重要，例如黑客马拉松或技术论坛。*“在那种情况下，真正重要的是创造一个环境，让人们可以专注于与他人一起完成他们要完成的工作，并希望在此过程中享受乐趣，”* Brown补充道。

However, deciding the purpose of the event can be a tough call. Gauging topic interests can be measured in several ways, but it still may come down to an educated guess. 

然而，确定活动的目的可能是一个艰难的决定。可以通过多种方式衡量话题兴趣，但最终可能还是要靠有根据的猜测。

Among other things, Salesforce uses its Volunteer Time Off (VTO) program, which is an internal program focused on giving back to the open source community, to judge event interest.

此外，Salesforce 使用其志愿者休假 （Volunteer Time Off，VTO)）计划来判断活动的兴趣度，该计划是一个专注于回馈开源社区的内部项目。

*"So much of this is trial and error. Like all Open Source program offices, we are trying to figure this out. We also try to tie it to exact metrics such as the number of volunteer hours we get. Just to see if this is something that is of interest to people,"* said Alyssa Arvin, Senior Program Manager, Open Source at Salesforce.

*“这其中有很多是反复试验的结果。像所有开源项目办公室一样，我们也在努力搞清楚这一点。我们还尝试将其与具体指标联系起来，例如我们获得的志愿者工时数。只是为了看看这是否是人们感兴趣的事情，”* Salesforce开源项目高级项目经理Alyssa Arvin说。

For example, if Salesforce aims for 40 people to volunteer at this event and 50 employees sign up, they know interest in the event is high. However, if only 15 employees volunteered then *"okay, this might not be the best event. Or maybe we weren't marketing it correctly. So we adjust our event strategy and plan too. Having metrics helps us find a hit topic or theme for the event,"* said Arvin.

例如，如果Salesforce希望有40人愿意参与此活动，但有50名员工报名，他们就知道人们对此活动的兴趣很高。然而，如果只有15名员工自愿参加，那么 *“好吧，也许这不是最好的活动。或者，也许我们的营销方式不正确。因此，我们也要调整活动策略和计划。有了衡量标准，我们就能找到受欢迎的活动话题或主题，”* Arvin说道。

Comcast uses polls to narrow their event topics.

Comcast公司使用投票来缩小其活动主题范围。

Saebi says she reaches out to the community with a quick survey or a poll in the Slack channel to ask, *"’Hey, we're thinking about doing a conference. What topics are exciting to you? And then do you also have any speakers that you'd like to recommend?’ All they have to do is choose their top topics from our list."*

Saebi表示，她会在Slack频道中通过快速调查或投票的方式联系社区并提问，*“‘嘿，我们正在考虑举办一次会议。你们对哪些话题感兴趣？你们还有什么演讲者可以推荐吗？’他们只需从我们的列表中选择他们最感兴趣的主题。”*

Do not be afraid to consider a target audience as an event theme too. A lot of mutual good can come from helping different groups find opportunities and overcome challenges in open source.

也不要害怕将目标受众作为活动主题。帮助不同群体在开源领域寻找机会、克服挑战，可以带来很多共同利益。

*"We have events that focus on our employee resource group. Examples include a project for the LGBT community, one for women in technology, and another called BOLDforce for our Black, African American community. People are really excited and waiting for these events,"* said Arvin.

*“我们有专注于员工群体的活动。例如，我们有一个针对LGBT社区的项目，一个针对技术领域女性群体的项目，还有一个针对黑人和非裔美国人群体、名为BOLDforce的项目。人们对这些活动非常兴奋和充满期待，”* Arvin说。

Ultimately, the event’s topic or theme is its purpose. Therefore, is must be highly focused and clearly articulated.

归根结底，活动的主题或议题就是活动的目的。因此，它必须高度聚焦并清晰表达。

*"Most recently we've been focusing on events aimed at building our internal open source community,"* said Simmons.

*“最近，我们一直专注在用于建设我们内部开源社区的活动上，”* Simmons说。

## Choosing a venue

## 选择开源活动场所

Choosing a venue has always been largely driven by strategy than exotic locales.

场所的选择在很大程度上是由策略决定的，而不是异国情调。

*"The Linux Foundation gets a ton of requests to hold events in India, in Africa in different countries in South America, a lot of emerging countries where there's a lot of potential for future open-sourced community members,"* said Brown.

*“Linux基金会收到大量请求，希望在印度、非洲、南美不同国家以及许多新兴国家举办活动，这些国家有着成为未来开源社区成员的巨大潜力，”* Brown说。

*"But there's the economics of it to consider too. Events are not cheap to hold and we can't be everywhere. But we don't want to limit the opportunities or potential from these emerging areas or other areas that we simply can't be in. So we think that virtual events gives us an opportunity to reach a larger, more diverse audience around the world, which is huge,"* Brown explained.

*“但也要考虑经济因素。举办活动的成本不低，我们不可能在每个地方都举办活动。但我们不想限制这些新兴地区或其他我们无法到达地区的机会和潜力。因此，我们认为线上活动为我们提供了一个机会，可以接触到全球更多、更多样化的受众，这非常重要，”* Brown解释说。

Because of the global pandemic, many event organizers are having to pivot from physical conferences and events to virtual ones. However, an eventual return to events in the physical world are also in the plans, as are budding ideas for hybrid events that blend virtual and physical activities.

由于全球疫情，许多活动组织者不得不从线下会议和活动转向线上活动。然而，最终回归线下活动也是计划中的一部分，同时线上与线下活动相结合的混合活动也在萌芽之中。

*"Which format to choose depends on the open source project goals. Virtual events can be very valuable in reaching new geographies and transitioning to a virtual only connection is more seamless than with physical events. So in the future there will be a combination of both formats"* said Terasaki.

*“选择哪种形式取决于开源项目的目标。线上活动在覆盖新地区方面非常有价值，且向纯虚拟连接的过渡比线下活动更为顺畅。因此，未来将会有两种形式的结合，”* Terasaki说。

Sometimes the budget or other factors dictate the venue options.

有时，预算或其他因素决定了场地的选择。

"Sometimes if budgets are looking good for the year, for this year, for example, with pandemic, probably not, everything's going to be virtual, but for previous years, we've done internal events even externally at nice little venues. It just depends on the event and it could be an internal venue as well," said Saebi.

“有时候，如果一年的预算状况良好，则根据活动本身情况，也可能在内部场地举办活动。像今年因为疫情的原因，可能就不行了，一切活动都会是线上的。但在前几年，我们在不错的小场馆举办过内部活动，甚至还有外部活动，” Saebi说。

There are distinct pros and cons for each venue.

线上和线下活动各有明显的优缺点。

For example, "virtual events open up more opportunities for people who have geographic restrictions or economic challenges to participate in physical events. We saw people from 82 countries attend a recent virtual event. This is roughly 50% more countries represented than in-person events," said Terasaki.

例如，“线上活动为那些受到地理限制或经济困难的人提供了更多参加线下活动的机会。我们看到来自82个国家的人们参加了最近的一次线上活动。这比现场活动多出大约50%的国家，”Terasaki说。

Comcast has also seen greater attendance at virtual events.

Comcast公司的线上活动也有更多的参与者。

*"We did a talk on InnerSource internally and it went really well. We had, I think, 170 people show up, which is great. It's more than what we would have had in person,"* said Saebi.

*“我们在内部进行了一场关于内部开源的讲座，效果非常好。我记得，参加的人数达到了170人，这非常棒。这比我们举办现场活动时的参与人数要多，”* Saebi说。

*"We're testing, experimenting, and learning. We have been breaking it up because people are getting Zoom exhaustion and conference call exhaustion and video chat exhaustion. We're trying to avoid doing the traditional eight-hour days. We're breaking it up and starting small, but so far so good."*

*“我们正在测试、试验和学习。因为人们已经对Zoom会议、电话会议和视频聊天感到疲惫不堪，我们一直在拆分这些线上活动。我们正在努力避免进行传统的八小时全天会议，将其拆分，从简短的会议开始，目前来看效果还不错。”*

Google also found shorter formats work better in virtual events.

Google公司也发现，短时长的形式在线上活动中效果更好。

*"At small online developer events, past experience taught us that we lose approximately 30% of the audience every 60 min. Getting attention from the audience for a longer period of time at virtual events tends to be difficult. Shorter format is usually preferable. Look at[ Flutter Day 2020 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dEQSyfcBYs&list=PLjxrf2q8roU1rBlI9vz01K2324nzIhYgp) to see some examples of short presentations showcased during an event,"* said Cruz.

*“在小型在线开发者活动中，以往的经验告诉我们，每60分钟大约会流失30%的观众。在线上活动中，长时间吸引观众的注意力往往很困难。较短的形式通常更受欢迎。可以看看[Flutter Day 2020 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dEQSyfcBYs&list=PLjxrf2q8roU1rBlI9vz01K2324nzIhYgp)播放列表，其中有一些在活动期间进行的简短演讲示例，”* Cruz说。

Physical venues are a different arrangement entirely. There are different venues around the world for different types and sizes of meetings. But the building isn’t the only consideration.

实体场地完全是另一种安排。世界各地有不同类型和规模的会议所需的不同场地。但建筑并不是唯一的考虑因素。

*"Reliable Wi-Fi is critical. We use our own network company now that we bring with us. But even today, most of the Wi-Fi and internet in venues is actually run by the companies that traditionally do not understand the bandwidth drain that our community will take, or the fact that they're going to be walking around with three different devices on them that are all pulling from the bandwidth at the same time,"* said Brown.

*“可靠的Wi-Fi至关重要。我们现在使用我们自己的网络公司。但即使在今天，场馆中的大部分Wi-Fi和互联网实际上都是由一些公司在运营，这些公司通常并不了解我们的社区会消耗多少带宽，也不知道他们将带着三个不同的设备到处走动，而这些设备都会同时占用带宽，”* Brown说。

The Wi-Fi issue is easy to miss on the planning end and hard to ignore at the event.

Wi-Fi问题在策划阶段很容易被忽略，但在活动中却很难被忽视。

*"The venue tells you everything is fine, and they can totally support 100 people. But you really want to be looking at 3 times that. Again, it depends on what the people are going to be doing at the event but whatever that is, there's a lot of bandwidth drain,"* Brown added.

*“场地会告诉你一切都没问题，他们完全可以支持100人使用网络。但实际上你真的需要考虑三倍的容量。同样，这取决于人们在活动中会做什么，但无论是什么活动，都会有大量的带宽消耗，”* Brown补充道。

## Organizing the event

## 组织开源活动

An open source event succeeds or fails on details. Organizing every element, no matter how small, is thereby crucial, no matter what the venue is. Most successful event organizers have a plan or a checklist they follow to make sure details are not overlooked.

一个开源活动的成败取决于细节。无论场地如何，组织好每一个环节，无论多么微小，都是至关重要的。大多数成功的活动组织者都有一个计划或清单，以确保细节不会被忽略。

Salesforce works with a template they call a program plan wherein the company identifies the overarching goals and maps out specific paths. The questions asked internally to flesh out the planning include:

Salesforce使用一种他们称为“项目计划”的模板，公司在其中确定总体目标并规划具体路径。为了完善计划，内部提出的问题包括：

* Who are we going to engage with?

* 我们要让谁参与 ？

* How is it going to be publicized?

*	如何进行宣传？

* What is our follow-up strategy?

* 我们后续的跟进策略是什么？

* What is our pre-event strategy?

*	我们的活动前策略是什么？

* What metrics do we need to use? The number of attendee or engagement levels on social media, something else?

*	我们需要使用什么指标？参会人数、社交媒体上的参与度，还是其他？

Below are tips for planning details you may want to add to your own event planner, or use to build one.

以下是有关策划细节的提示，供你添加到自己的活动策划中，或用于创建一个活动策划。

**Selecting a date**

**选择开源活动日期**

Both internal and external events can easily overlap with other events which will negatively affect your event’s success. Selecting a date to enhance your odds for success is therefore of prime importance.

无论是内部活动还是外部活动，都很容易与其他活动冲突，从而对你的活动的成功造成负面影响。因此，选择一个能提高成功几率的日期至关重要。

*"We have an open source events calendar in our organization that our team manages and updates. All the big open source conferences are on the calendar, and others too, because you don’t want there to be a scheduling  conflict with your event, but neither do you want to burn people out by stacking conferences too close together,"* said Saebi.

*“我们内部有一个开源活动日历，由我们团队管理和更新。所有大型开源会议和其他会议都在日程表上，因为我们既不希望有其他活动与自己的活动在时间安排上发生冲突，也不希望会议安排得太密集而累坏大家，”* Saebi说。

*"I try to schedule our conferences in a slower month and in the middle of the week so people are home and free to enjoy their weekends,"* she added.

*“我尽量把会议安排在较轻松的月份和周中举办，让参与者可以在家里享受他们的周末时间”*，她补充到。

Watch out for overlaps with local events unrelated to open source too, as well as for local occurrences ranging from planned strikes and protests to holiday observances.

还要注意与本地其他与开源无关的活动的冲突，以及当地发生的各种事件，从计划中的罢工和抗议活动到节日庆祝活动。

*"If you plan an event in Germany, for example, and it's a national holiday, even if all of your attendees are coming from outside of Germany and have no problem going to the event on that day, it's going to be very difficult to get the support from the local venue and vendors that you need, or all the restaurants might be closed, or taxis might not be running, etc,"* warned Brown.

*“举个例子，如果你在德国策划一项活动，而那天是德国的公共假期，即使所有参会者都来自德国以外，并且在当天去参加活动没有问题，你也会碰到诸多难题包括很难从当地场馆和供应商那里获得所需的支持、餐厅全部关门、出租车也可能不运行等等，”* Brown警告说。

You may think virtual events would be exempt from such concerns, but they aren’t. Holiday observances can still affect attendance and the availability of vendor support in everything from technical support to the mailing of welcome gifts or other swag.

你可能觉得线上活动不需要担心这些问题，但事实并非如此。节日庆祝活动仍然会影响出席率以及供应商支持的可用性，包括技术支持、欢迎礼品或其他小礼物的邮寄等方面。

**Finding and selecting speakers**

**寻找和遴选演讲者**

First, align speaker selection with specific goals. Closely consider your goals for the event. But you may also want to reach towards your company’s overarching goals as well as those of open source communities. This is no time to think small.

首先，根据具体目标选择演讲者。仔细考虑你的活动目标。但是，你可能还想实现公司的总体目标以及开源社区的目标。现在可不能想得太小。

Consider speakers within your organization too. But finding speakers from outside of your organization doesn’t have to be any more of a daunting task than finding them internally.

也可以考虑组织内部的演讲者。但是，从组织外部寻找演讲者并不一定比在组织内部寻找演讲者更艰巨。

*"I find many of our speakers from past Open Source Summit events and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) speakers bureau, but those speakers are mostly related to CNCF projects. I think it would be a fantastic idea for everyone to contribute to building and updating a Linux Foundation speaker’s bureau,"* said Saebi, who also keeps a database of speakers that contains notable external speakers, and speakers across Comcast.

*“我从过去的开源峰会活动和云原生计算基金会（CNCF）的演讲者资料库中找到了许多演讲者，但这些演讲者大多与CNCF项目有关。我认为，让每个人都为建立和更新Linux基金会演讲者资料库出一份力将是一个绝妙的主意，”* Saebi说，她还保存了一个包含知名外部演讲者和Comcast内部演讲者的数据库。

Other sources to look to for possible speakers for your event include paypercall.io, which Saebi finds "extremely helpful in finding speakers, especially those in open source." And, of course, social media such as LinkedIn and Twitter.

其他可以寻找活动演讲者的渠道包括paypercall.io，Saebi认为它“对寻找演讲者，尤其是开源领域的演讲者非常有帮助”。当然，还有LinkedIn和Twitter等社交媒体。 

*"I have a list that I created on Twitter. I would recommend other folks to create lists as well, but they're also more than welcome to subscribe to my list. It is called ‘open source speakers’ and it's three words,"* said Saebi. Saebi says she too looks to underrepresented groups in open source to help her find speakers. For example, she may ask women she knows in open source for recommendations on potential  women speakers.

*“我在Twitter上创建了一个列表。我建议其他人也创建类似的列表，但也非常欢迎他们订阅我的列表。这个列表叫做‘open source speakers’，由三个英文单词组成，”* Saebi说。Saebi表示，她也会请开源领域中的弱势群体来帮助她寻找演讲者。例如，她可能会请她认识的开源领域的女性推荐潜在的女性演讲者。
 
**Developing internal speakers**

**培养内部演讲者**

Also consider speakers for your event based on your organization’s internal needs to develop and encourage a new and deeper bench of brand ambassadors.

还可以根据组织内部的需求来考虑活动的演讲者，培养和鼓励一批新的、有更深层次链接的品牌大使。

*"Internal events are a safe environment of your peers. So, we try to find people who have never given a talk before and give them this larger practice round because there's anywhere between one and three hundred people dialing into it. That gives them the confidence to go and submit to an external conference,"* said Arvin.

*“内部活动是一个由你的同事组成的安全环境。因此，我们会尽量找那些从未做过演讲的人，给他们这个更大的实践机会，因为有一到三百人会参与这个活动。这会让他们有信心去申请外部会议演讲，”* Arvin说。

There are ways to add to the comfort and pacing of those new to speaking, and for more seasoned speakers too who may be feeling the wear and tear of many virtual events and far too many Zoom sessions.

有一些方法可以增加新手演讲者的舒适度和节奏感，也可以帮助那些经验丰富的演讲者，他们可能因为参加了许多线上活动和过多Zoom会议而感到疲惫不堪。 

*"We pre-record the presentation, then we can add captions to make our events accessible. In that way, presenters can also focus on live Q&A on the day of,"* said Cruz.

*“我们会预先录制演讲，然后添加字幕，使我们的活动更容易理解。这样，演讲者在活动当天也可以专注于现场问答，”* Cruz说。

Just keep in mind that you may need more than a presenter, particularly for virtual events.

请记住，你需要的可能不仅仅是一位演讲者，尤其是对于线上活动来说。 

*"Moderators are needed more than ever. We recruit seasoned speakers for the moderator’s role, then presenters can focus on their presentation and live Q&A,"* said Terasaki.

*“现在比以往任何时候都更需要主持人。我们招募经验丰富的演讲者担任主持人，这样演讲者就可以专注于演讲和现场问答，”* Terasaki说。

**Choosing platforms**

**选择平台**
 

If you’re planning a virtual event, you’ll want to pay close attention to your platform options because they vary significantly in many important ways.

如果你在规划线上活动，你将需要密切关注平台的选择，因为它们有很多重要的差异。

*"We did a virtual event platform comparison of 65 different platforms and a lot of these were simply about content delivery. And obviously, for Linux Foundation events, we're looking for something different than that,"* said Brown.

*“我们比较了65个不同的线上活动平台，许多平台只是用于内容传递。而显然，对于Linux基金会的活动而言，我们需要的东西与之不同，”* Brown说。 

The results of the[ Linux Foundation’s platform comparisons](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jGd0geh72Lxr0o3zV044K5yhXc6Q8tp4p8fhnnXJsqo/edit#slide=id.p3) are now freely available. You’ll want to check back periodically because this is a fluid document, Brown says. But here are samples of the results as of September 2020:

[Linux基金会的平台比较结果](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jGd0geh72Lxr0o3zV044K5yhXc6Q8tp4p8fhnnXJsqo/edit#slide=id.p3)现在可以免费获取。Brown表示，你需要定期查看，因为这是一个动态文档。以下是截至2020年9月的部分结果：

![platform comparison](/img/guides/organizing-and-managing-open-source-events1.jpg)

![speciality platfomr comparison](/img/guides/organizing-and-managing-open-source-events2.jpg)

The Linux Foundation is also journaling their organizers’ experience with each platform after an event to give members a more detailed accounting of successes and failures. You can find that in[ blog posts](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/2020/06/03/success-with-qiqochat/) on the events landing page.

Linux基金会还在每次活动后记录组织者对每个平台的体验，给会员提供更详细的成功与失败的分析。你可以在活动主页上的[博客文章](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/2020/06/03/success-with-qiqochat/)中找到这些内容。

Google looks for a specific set of features and functionalities, as well.

Google也在寻找专门的特性和功能。

*"We value compliance, safety, diversity, Inclusion, and accessibility. We try to pay extra attention to that and adjust the environment for online events. Do we have captions? Does the recording platform have a function for speakers to change font size for speaker notes?, etc,"* said Terasaki.

*“我们重视合规、安全、多元化、包容性、以及易用性。我们尽量特别关注这些，并调整在线活动的环境。我们有字幕吗？录制平台是否有让演讲者改变演讲者注释字体大小的功能？如此等等,”* Terasaki说。

*"Choosing the right event platform is the key for success. A great user interface with multiple engagement tools and functions that attendees are looking for at virtual events is imperative,"* Terasaki added.

*“选择合适的平台是成功的关键。一个具有多种参与工具和功能的优秀用户界面是与会者在线上活动中寻找的必要条件,”* Terasaki补充到。

Events held in physical venues also require careful attention to apps and networking platforms. Some of the options are flexible enough to successfully pull off cross-over duties between virtual and physical, which may make them useful going forward with blended venues.

在线下场所举办的活动同样需要仔细关注app和社交平台。其中一些选择非常灵活，可以成功完成线上和线下活动之间的交叉任务，这可能会使它们在混合场景中大有用武之地。

*"MeetingPlay started as a networking app. They have done a very good job of pivoting to be a virtual event platform. That's one that we've been really happy with,"* says Brown.

*“MeetingPlay最初是一个社交应用。他们在转型为线上活动平台方面做得非常好，这是我们非常满意的一个平台，”* Brown说。

*"For physical events, we do have some options we like for networking and to facilitate people meeting each other at events. One that we use is an app called Brella, which is really a networking app, but it's not a full-blown event app that we would keep a schedule on and do push notifications. It's really just for networking and it has an event matchmaking feature on it,"* Brown explained.

*“对于线下活动，我们确实有一些喜欢的选择，用于建立联系，方便人们在活动中相互认识。我们使用的一个应用叫Brella，它实质上是一款社交应用而不是一个功能全面的活动管理应用，我们不会在上面保存日程以及推送通知。它实际上只是用来建立关系网的，上面有一个活动匹配功能，”* Brown解释到。

Make sure your expectations and goals are aligned when deciding to use these types of apps.

在决定使用这些类型的应用时，请确保你的期望和目标是一致的。 

*"For example, in an Open Source Summit, I'd say probably only 15% or 20% of people actually like using Brella or any other app, but the people who are using it, get huge value out of it,"* says Brown.

*“例如，在一次开源峰会上，我认为可能只有15%或20%的人真正喜欢使用Brella或其他任何应用，但那些使用它的人却能从中获得巨大的价值，”* Brown说。

**Soliciting volunteers**

**招募志愿者**

Start by identifying the tasks, dates and times you need volunteers to help out.

首先，确定你需要志愿者帮忙的任务、日期和时间

*"You can't do this by yourself, you have to have volunteers to help with this initiative. I look for ‘day of’ volunteers as well as folks who want to help with some of the organizing, but mostly ‘day of’ is the most important,"* said Saebi.

*“光靠你自己是不行的，必须有志愿者来帮助开展这项活动。我既寻找‘当天’的志愿者，也寻找愿意帮助做一些活动组织工作的人，但大多数情况下还是‘当天’的志愿者最重要，”* Saebi说。

*"A few things to check that your ‘day of’ volunteers can help you with is, will there be a check-in station for when your conference attendees arrive? And there should be,"* Saebi added.

*“‘当天’志愿者可以帮助你做的几件事是：当与会者到达时，是否会有签到站？应该有的，”* Saebi 补充道。

Soliciting volunteers for a physical or a virtual event can be challenging. But there are several ways one can be successful in the endeavor. Take for example, how Salesforce manages and encourages volunteerism.

为线下或线上活动招募志愿者可能会有一定挑战。但有几种方法可以使这一努力取得成功。以Salesforce如何管理和激励志愿服务为例。 

Volunteer Time Off is a formal program at Salesforce. It begins on the first day of employment when, as part of their on-boarding, new employees often go to volunteer somewhere with their on-boarding class. Volunteering is thus established early on as both the spirit of the company culture and as an ongoing job expectation.

志愿者假期是Saleforce公司的一项正式计划。这从员工入职第一天就开始了，作为入职培训的一部分，新员工通常会跟随他们的入职培训课程一起去某个地方做志愿者。因此，志愿服务很早就被确立为公司的文化精神和持续的工作期望。

*"Volunteering is really a core part of our business and that's well enshrined in company programs and well supported. So, we thought let's tap into that to help people make those first contributors to Open Source. To help them get over that hump of the initial barrier of having never contributed to Open Source before in such a way that we are both raising awareness of our reliance on Open Source and on Open Source’s reliance on volunteers,"* said Simmons.

*“志愿服务确实是我们业务的核心部分，这在公司计划中得到了很好的体现和支持。因此，我们想利用这一点来帮助人们成为开源的第一批贡献者。帮助他们克服从未为开源做出过贡献的最初障碍，这样，我们既提高了人们对我们依赖开源的认识，也提高了人们对开源依赖志愿者的认识，”* Simmons说。 

It turns out that Volunteer Time Off is an excellent source for volunteers for open source events as well.

事实证明，“志愿者假期”也是开源活动志愿者的绝佳来源。 

*"So much of this is trial and error. Like all Open Source program offices are trying to figure this out. We also try to tie volunteer hours to exact metrics to see if the event or topic is something that is of interest to people,"* said Arvin.

*“这其中有很多都是反复试验的过程。就像所有的开源项目办公室都在努力解决这个问题一样，我们还尝试将志愿者时间与具体指标联系起来，来了解活动或主题是否对人们有吸引力，”* Arvin说。

She cited an example of how volunteer metrics translate to a broader interest in an open source event. For example, if the Salesforce OSPO aims for 40 people to volunteer at an event and end ups getting 50, then the company has a strong indication that people are interested in the topic or event. But if just 15 volunteers responded instead, then that is a strong indication that the event isn’t a good draw or that the marketing may be off target.

她举例说明了志愿者指标如何转化为对开源活动的更广泛兴趣。例如，如果Salesforce OSPO的目标是在一个活动中招募40人做志愿服务，结果有50人报名，那么公司就能收到人们对这个主题或活动感兴趣的强烈信号。但如果只有15名志愿者报名，那就充分说明活动的吸引力不强，或者活动宣传可能偏离了目标。

*"Having those metrics also gives us a baseline of what our employees are interested in doing. And it tells us what is working in spreading the word of Open Source,"* Arvin said.

*“有了这些指标，我们也就有了一个了解员工对哪些活动感兴趣的基准。它还告诉我们传播开源的哪些方法是有效的，”* Arvin说。

**Gifts, swag and acknowledgments**

**礼物、纪念品和答谢礼**

Gifts, swag, and acknowledgments remain important elements in event planning. Generally, they are used to reward, thank, and incentivize speakers, volunteers, attendees, sponsors, and communities.

礼物、纪念品和答谢礼仍然是活动策划中的重要部分。通常，它们用于奖励、感谢和激励演讲者、志愿者、参会者、赞助商和社区。 

It was wise to order these items early as traditionally it takes longer than you’d think to have the items made and delivered on time. Early orders also give you a chance to have changes made if something is wrong with the order or a vendor fails to follow through. But given recent cutbacks in the U.S. Postal Service and the extraordinary workloads other carriers are dealing with during a pandemic, it’s wise to order even earlier than normal.

提前订购这些物品是明智的，因为通常制作和准时交付这些物品需要的时间比你想象的要长。提前订购也让你有机会在订单出问题或供应商未能履行承诺时进行更改。但是，考虑到美国邮政服务最近的裁员和其他运输公司在疫情期间的超负荷工作量，比平时更早订购是明智之举。

And, yes, you can give gifts, swag, and acknowledgements in virtual events too. Some of these can even be digital such as a month of a TV or video streaming service, or credits on riding services like Uber or Lyft. Credits on food services such as Instacart or UberEATS is another idea. Of course, many event organizers also send traditional gifts, particularly to speakers and volunteers.  Your budget will affect your gift and swag choices too.

是的，你也可以在线上活动中送出礼物、纪念品和答谢礼。有些甚至可以是数字形式的，例如一个月的电视或视频流媒体服务，或者像Uber或Lyft这样的打车服务积分。Instacart或UberEATS之类的食品服务积分也是一个选择。当然，许多活动组织者也会送传统礼物，特别是给演讲者和志愿者。你的预算也会影响你对礼物和纪念品的选择。 

Just be careful to think your choices through to avoid pitfalls. For example, don’t give credits to digital services unless you’re sure those services are available locally for speakers, volunteers, or other giftees. There are also other things to consider, depending on location and other factors.

选择时一定要深思熟虑，避免陷阱。例如，不要赠送数字服务积分，除非你确定演讲者、志愿者或其他受赠者在当地可以使用这些服务。根据地点和其他因素，还有其他需要考虑的事项。

"One time, I got the speakers really nice gift baskets which included mugs and fruit and all kinds of nice goodies. But the speakers couldn’t fit those in their carry-ons. I felt so bad. So, if you're buying a gift for people who are traveling, make sure that it's something they can travel with," said Saebi.

“有一次，我给演讲者们准备了非常不错的礼品篮，里面有马克杯、水果和各种好吃的东西。但演讲者的手提箱装不下这些东西。我心里很不是滋味。所以，如果你要给旅行的人准备礼物，一定要确保是他们可以随身携带的，”Saebi说。 

Think back to swag and gifts you’ve received or seen at other conferences. That’s likely to help you come up with good ideas for yours.

回想一下你在其他会议上收到或见过的纪念品和礼物。这可能会帮助你为自己的礼物想出好点子。

For example, Saebi says that one of the best gifts she received at a conference, she’s still using today. *"I've been using it through the quarantine as well, it was from the Linux Foundation for the Open Source Summit, North America. I want to say either, I think Los Angeles maybe, or maybe Vancouver, but it's a cutting board that looks like a surfboard. It's amazing. So yeah, I think personalized gifts like that are really nice,"* she said.

例如，Saebi说她在一次会议上收到的最好的礼物之一，她至今仍在使用。*“我在疫情期间都在使用它，它是来自Linux基金会北美开源峰会的礼物，我记得可能在洛杉矶或温哥华，它是一个像冲浪板的砧板。非常棒。所以，我觉得个性化的礼物是很不错的主意，”* 她说。 

Before shopping for gifts, make sure to make a list of everyone who should receive something, and then buy a few extras for volunteers who join last minute or people you may have initially overlooked, like moderators or an emcee.

采购礼物之前，请务必列出一个所有应该收到礼物的人员的名单，然后多买一些给最后一刻加入的志愿者或你最初可能忽略的人员，如主持人或司仪。 

Recognitions can take the form of gifts or public shoutouts. Often, organizers choose to do both.

表彰的形式可以是赠送礼物，也可以是当众欢呼。通常，组织者会选择两者兼而有之。

*"I usually do include recognitions in the beginning and at the end of the event. But those should be personalized too. For example, some people are shy and they don't like public attention. So I don't say, "Hey, stand up, wave your hands." Some of them would say they hate that experience. And so, I think just calling their name out is good enough,"* said Saebi.  

*“我通常会在活动开始和结束时进行表彰。但这些表彰也应该是个性化的。例如，有些人比较害羞，不喜欢被公众关注。所以我不会说‘嘿，站起来，挥挥手’。有些人会说，他们讨厌这种经历。因此，我认为只要喊出他们的名字就足够了，”* Saebi说。 

Often volunteer are given matching tee- shirts with the event logo on them if it's a big external event. Stickers, even general open source stickers, are a big hit with volunteers and attendees. Both stickers and tee shirts are often on a table for the taking by attendees and volunteers, so you may want to add something a little extra just for volunteers.

如果是大型外部活动，志愿者通常会得到印有活动logo的T恤。贴纸，即使是普通的开源贴纸，也很受志愿者和与会者的欢迎。这些贴纸和T恤通常放在桌子上供参与者和志愿者领取，因此您可能会希望为志愿者额外添加一些东西。

And, it’s perfectly ok to regift swag too. After all, spreading the word of other conferences, communities and projects is entirely the point of stickers and swag, so feel free to spread it around.

而且，重新赠送纪念品也是完全可以的。毕竟，传播其他会议、社区和项目的信息正是贴纸和纪念品的目的所在，所以随意传播这些信息吧。 

*"I always take other swag as well from other open source conferences, especially for our internal events because not everybody has the opportunity to go to let's say Open Source Summit, North America. So in that case, Nithya, myself, and members of our team, we always have extra swag and extra stickers to offer later,"* said Shilla Saebi.

*“我总是从其他开源会议上带回纪念品，特别是为我们的内部活动，因为并不是每个人都有机会参加诸如北美开源峰会这样的活动。所以在这种情况下，Nithya、我和我们团队的成员，总是会有一些额外的纪念品和贴纸可以在后续提供，”* Shilla Saebi说。

**Registration**

**活动注册**

Registration fees continue to be a vexing issue.

注册费一直是一个令人头疼的问题。

*"Most of our events have been free. We may have done one where it was external facing and we charged a small fee and we noticed that it was harder to get people to register. But charging a fee helps reduce no shows so it’s a difficult decision,"* said Saebi.

*“我们的大多数活动都是免费的。我们可能做过一次面向外部的活动，收取了少量费用，我们发现这更难让人们注册。但是收费有助于减少缺席率，所以这是一个困难的决定，”* Saebi说。

Comparing your event with similar events is often a good way to measure market expectation and response.

将你的活动与类似活动进行比较通常是衡量市场期望和反应的好方法。

*"We very much look at what everyone else is charging. Like most folks who are planning open-source events, we’re trying to cover the cost of the event rather than make money on it,"* said Brown.

*“我们非常关注其他人的收费情况。和大多数策划开源活动的人一样，我们试图覆盖活动的成本，而不是从中赚钱，”* Brown说。

While traditional tech events charge up to $4,000 or even more for people to attend an event, open source events rarely command similarly high fees.

传统科技活动的参会费用高达4000美元，甚至更高，而开源活动却很少收取类似的高额费用。

*"In the US, companies understand the value of a developer going to a conference, so they often fund several conferences throughout the year. But there are still a lot of countries where that's not true and developers have to foot the bill on their own,"* said Brown.

*“在美国，公司了解开发人员参加会议的价值，所以他们通常会每年资助几场会议。但在很多国家，情况并非如此，开发者必须自己承担费用，”* Brown说。

*"China and Japan are both great examples where we simply can't charge the same registration fees there. We have to be very careful where we hold events because developers do not get travel budgets to go to events. They barely get any money to go to attend an event or a registration fee. You really have to think about what that local market will actually bear too,"* said Brown.

*“中国和日本是两个很好的例子，在那里我们根本无法收取相同的注册费。我们必须非常谨慎地选择举办活动的地点，因为开发者没有参加活动的差旅预算。他们几乎没有钱去参加活动或支付报名费。你也必须考虑当地市场的实际承受能力，”* Brown说。

Economic cycles also affect what can be charged for registration and sponsorships. There are other considerations to how to handle registrations as well, such as GDPR and privacy policies. Compliance with the various privacy regulations must be maintained in the registration process and everything that occurs afterward.

经济周期也会影响注册和赞助的收费标准。关于如何处理注册方面还有其他考虑因素，如GDPR和隐私政策。在注册过程中以及注册后的所有工作中，都必须遵守各种隐私法规。

*"You really want to be careful of that in your registration. Let people know you're going to be sharing their contact information, because you're legally obligated to do so. It is important to get the right verbiage in there, especially if you're going to have sponsors that you're giving any information to,"* said Brown.

*“在注册时，你真的要注意这一点。让人们知道你会分享他们的联系信息，因为在法律上你有义务这样做。重要的是要有正确的措辞，特别是如果你要向赞助商提供任何信息的话，”* Brown说。

Be sure to print any materials you’ll need from marketing and directional signage to banners and attendee handouts a month or more ahead of the event. Typically, attendee materials, including event stickers, are distributed at registration.

确保在活动开始前一个月或更早就打印好你需要的所有材料，从营销和指示标牌到横幅和参会者手册。通常，包括活动贴纸在内的参会者材料，会在注册时发放。

*"We put stickers on all the tables that people are sitting at, stickers for the actual event,"* said Saebi. *“Make sure to get the pronouns of your speakers. And ideally you should perhaps even ask for pronouns when people are checking in to the conference. If you have pronoun stickers like she, her, they, them, that'll be nice to add on the sticker table as well.”*

*“我们在人们坐的所有桌子上都贴上了贴纸，这些贴纸是为实际活动制作的，”* Saebi说。*“一定要弄清楚你的演讲者的称谓词。理想情况下，你甚至应该在人们进行会议签到时询问称谓词。如果你有她、他、他们这样的称谓词贴纸，那么在贴纸桌上增加这些会很好。”*

Registration desks also have swag readily available as well as name tags, lanyards and other event items. These can also be used in virtual events in various ways from standard pics or avatars, to a variety of gamification options.

签到台还提供纪念品以及姓名标签、挂绳和其他活动物品。这些物品也可以通过各种方式在线上活动中使用，从标准图片或头像到各种游戏化选项。

**Hashtags**

**社交话题标签**

Social media is as strong as ever in promoting and recording events. A well-chosen hashtag is therefore essential to your efforts.

社交媒体在宣传和记录活动方面一如既往地强大。因此，一个精心选择的话题标签对你的工作至关重要。

Typically, hashtags are set up prior to the event and generally plastered everywhere during the event.

通常，话题标签在活动前设置好，并在活动期间广泛使用。 

*"The hashtag is really helpful because if I have a unique hashtag on Twitter for a certain event, I can actually go back and look at all the tweets from three years ago or two years ago from that event. And you can keep that same hashtag going for future events, or however you want to do it. But it's nice and useful thing to have,"* said Saebi.

*“话题标签非常有用，因为如果我在Twitter上为某个活动设置了一个独特的话题标签，我实际上可以回过头来看三年前或两年前关于那个活动的所有推文。而且你可以在未来的活动中继续使用相同的话题标签，或者按你想要的任何方式去使用它。这是一个很好且有用的工具，”* Saebi 说。

*"And it gives people a platform or idea or an area to go. I know a lot of people congregate on Twitter. I also make sure to tell the speakers to put their Twitter handles on their slides. They don't have to, it's just a suggestion in case people want to reach out to them,"* Saebi added.

*“它给人们提供了一个平台、想法或去处。我知道很多人都聚集在Twitter上。我还会确保告诉演讲者在他们的幻灯片上放上他们的 Twitter 账号。他们不一定要这样做，这只是一个建议，以防有人想要联系他们，”* Saebi 补充道。

**Side events and break planning**

**附带活动和休息计划**

It’s general knowledge that neither speakers nor attendees are keen on early morning events and talks. What may not be so generally known is that fact holds true for virtual events as well. People may be attending from home, but their early mornings tend to be a bit frantic, especially if there are kids to get to school and pets to walk.

众所周知，演讲者和与会者都不喜欢清晨的活动和演讲。可能大多数人不知道的是，线上活动也是如此。人们可能会在家参加活动，但他们的清晨往往有些匆忙，尤其是如果有孩子要上学、宠物要遛弯的话。

*"Now I start at 9:30 AM or 10:00 AM, and then we leave 30 minutes or an hour in the morning for people to congregate and eat breakfast. I think 9:00 AM start time may work as well. But I usually do 9:30 or 10. Considering that we do after events too at physical events, it can be really exhausting on people to be on for 12 or 14 hours that day,"* said Saebi.

*“现在，我在上午9:30或10:00开始活动，然后在早上留出30分钟或一个小时的时间让人们聚在一起吃早餐。我认为上午9:00开始也可以。但我通常会选择9:30或10:00。考虑到我们在线下活动中也会有后续活动，这一天连续12或14个小时对人来说会非常累，”* Saebi说。

Don’t drag the day on too long for virtual events either.

线上活动也不要拖得太久。

*"It's one thing to get someone to attend a virtual event, but what's your dwell time going to be? How long is someone going to stick around? That's the big question that we are trying to figure out because what that looks like in this first round of virtual events that we do is going to help us decide what we do with the ones after that. But there are related questions too such as is a full day just too long and we need to break these up into couple hour increments a day and do them for more days or do something entirely different,"* said Brown.

*“让人们参加线上活动是一回事，但是他们会停留多久呢？他会坚持多久？这是我们正在试图弄清楚的一个大问题，因为我们在首轮线上活动中的这些情况，将帮助我们决定如何规划之后的活动。但是还有一些相关的问题，比如一整天是否太长，我们是否需要将活动分成每天几小时，持续更多天，或者完全另辟蹊径，”* Brown说。

The length of events matters significantly. Based on surveys and feedback, Comcast found that neither speakers or attendees like one hour talks.

活动时间的长短非常重要。根据调查和反馈，Comcast发现演讲者和与会者都不喜欢长达一小时的演讲。

*"Those are too long. I try to do shorter talks. If it's a keynote, we can do 30 minutes, maybe 35 minutes max. But typically, the talks are 25 to 30 minutes, keep them short and sweet,"* said Saebi.

*“那些太长了。我尽量做短一点的演讲。如果是主题演讲，我们可以讲30分钟，最多35分钟。但通常情况下，演讲时间在25到30分钟之间，要短小精悍，”* Saebi 说。

Similarly, Comcast found that talks need to be short in virtual events as well.

同样，Comcast公司发现线上活动的演讲也需要简短。

*"People are getting Zoom exhaustion and conference call exhaustion and video chat exhaustion. We're trying to avoid doing eight-hour days. We're breaking up talks into much smaller sessions over more days but shorter hours per day,"* said Saebi.

*“人们正经历着Zoom疲劳、电话会议疲劳和视频聊天疲劳。我们尽量避免每天八小时的活动。我们将演讲分成更短的会议，持续更多天，但每天的时间较短，”* Saebi说。

It’s a common problem for all event organizers on the moment, but it probably bodes well for events post-pandemic.

这是目前所有活动组织者面临的共同问题，但这可能对疫情后的活动有利。

 "There's a huge challenge because one, people are stuck at home. You could argue that they will have no problem sitting in front of their computer all day at a conference. But the flip side of that is people are tired of being stuck at home. As things open up, people just want to get out of the house and experience some semblance of normal life again," said Brown.

“这是一个巨大的挑战，因为一方面，人们被困在家里。你可以说他们坐在电脑前参加一整天的线上会议没有问题。但另一方面，人们已经厌倦了被困在家里。当情况好转时，人们只想走出家门，重新体验一些正常的生活，”Brown说道。

Socializing and networking have always been big draws at conferences. That’s why breaks should remain frequent and certainly placed between every talk. In physical events this allows for the always popular and beneficial hallway track. Most organizers are still struggling to create a similar experience in virtual events. However, experiments are currently underway.

社交和建立人脉一直是会议的重要吸引力。因此，休息时间应保持频繁，而且一定要安排在每场演讲之间。在线下活动中，这就为一直很受欢迎且有益的走廊交谈创造了条件。大多数组织者仍在努力为线上活动创造类似的体验。然而，目前尚在实验中。

*"I recently went to the InnerSource Commons event where they had virtual breakout rooms. You could actually be moved into another Zoom room with other folks and just kind of relax and have a more chill conversation and then go back to the main conference when you want. I thought that was really good,"* said Saebi.

*“我最近参加了 InnerSource Commons 的活动，那里有虚拟的分组讨论室。实际上，你可以和其他人一起进入另一个 Zoom 会议室，放松一下，进行更轻松的对话，然后在需要的时候再回到主会场。我觉得这样很好，”* Saebi说道。

Evening events are common at physical venues. These can last from 30 minutes to a couple hours and can be anything from mixers to dinners, but they always have a social and networking vibe. Distributing virtual or physical drink tickets, usually limited at two per person, controls the cost and limits excessive drinking as it reinforces the code of conduct. Tickets are good for alcoholic drinks but other drinks as well such as water, coffees, juices, and sodas.

晚间活动在实体场所很常见。这些活动可以持续 30 分钟到几个小时不等，可以是社交聚会或晚宴等任何形式，但总是带有社交和建立人脉的氛围。分发虚拟或实体饮品券（通常每人限购两张）既能控制成本，又能限制过量饮酒，因为它强化了行为规范。饮品券不仅适用于酒精饮料，也适用于其他饮料，如水、咖啡、果汁和苏打水。

Other questions organizers will need to answer in advance include whether the event should be private and if so does it need a passcode. Do you need to send invitations or will an announcement on Slack or social media work as well or better?

组织者需要提前回答的其他问题包括：活动是否应该是非公开的，如果是，是否需要密码。是否需要发送邀请函，还是在Slack或社交媒体上发布公告效果更好？

**Code of Conduct**

**行为准则**

The Code of conduct remains critically important to any event, physical or virtual.

行为准则对于任何活动都至关重要，无论是线下活动还是线上活动。 

*"I'm proud to say we're one of the first open-source organizations and events that had one at their events," says Brown. She says the Linux Foundation’s code of conduct is freely available in the creative commons license and “anyone may pull from it.”*  

Brown说：*“我很自豪地说，我们是最早在活动中制定行为准则的开源组织之一。”* 她说，Linux 基金会的行为准则通过知识共享许可协议（CC）免费提供，*“任何人都可以拉取使用。”*

However, just having a code of conduct alone is not enough. It is important to distribute your code of conduct before and during events and regularly point people to it.

然而，仅有行为准则是不够的。重要的是要在活动前和活动期间分发行为准则，并定期引导人们了解它。

*"We put it out at registration on a banner, it's very easy to find on our website. It goes out on our email communications. We mention on the keynote stage. You also need to make sure that whoever is running your conference knows how to address any code of conduct issues that come up,"* said Brown.

*“我们在注册时会在横幅上展示它，在我们的网站上很容易找到。我们的电子邮件通讯也会发布。我们在主题演讲时提到它。你还需要确保负责会议的人知道如何处理任何出现的行为准则问题，”* Brown说。 

Comcast uses its own existing code of conduct for internal events. And uses a template to compose one for external events. Other organizations do similarly.

Comcast公司在内部活动中使用现有的行为准则，并使用模板为外部活动编写行为准则。其他组织也是如此。

**Food and drinks planning**

**食物和饮品规划**

Food and drinks are part of the necessary planning in physical events. If the event is internal and held on company grounds, food and drink options are often limited to what the company’s selected caterer offers. However, there are a few planning tricks that can make that easier to arrange.

食物和饮品是线下活动必要规划的一部分。如果活动是在公司内部举行，那么食物和饮品的选择通常仅限于公司选定的餐饮供应商提供的。然而，有一些规划技巧可以使这一安排更加容易。

*"I place an order through the catering company for the maximum for our internal venue, which is 300 people. And then I ask how late I can adjust the order. Typically caterers will give you two weeks which is great because by then you’ll have a much better idea how many people are expected to attend that event,"* said Saebi.

*“我通过餐饮公司订购内部场地最多可容纳人数（300人）的餐饮。然后我询问可以调整订单的最晚时间。通常情况下，餐饮公司会给你两周的时间，这非常好，因为到那时你就能更清楚预计有多少人会参加这次活动了，”* Saebi 说。 

*"I learned that little trick from wedding planning, because that's how it was for our wedding. So I started asking the same thing for conferences and discovered that I don't have to have the exact number today, as long as they give me the date of when they need it by,"* Saebi added.

*“我从婚礼策划中学到了这个小技巧，因为我们的婚礼就是这样安排的。因此，我开始对会议提出同样的要求，发现我不一定今天就要给出确切的数字，只要他们告诉我需要的日期就可以了，”* Saebi 补充说。 

Besides a headcount, you’ll need to consider varying dietary needs such as diabetic, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, kosher, and keto diets. Coffee, tea, diet drinks, sodas, and water should be plentiful and available all day.

除了人数统计，你还需要考虑不同的饮食需求，如糖尿病、无麸质、素食、素食者、犹太洁食和生酮饮食。咖啡、茶、低糖饮料、苏打水和水应该全天充足供应。 

This is also an area where you may need a volunteer to lend a hand.

这也是你需要志愿者帮忙的地方。

*"Assign one person to be the contact for the caterer. All they have to do is answer their phone when the caterer calls and let them in the venue. Everything else, including the bill, is taken care of in advance, so the only additional thing the volunteer might need to do is maybe guide the caterers to where they need to go,"* said Saebi.

*“指定一个人与餐饮公司联络。他们要做的就是在餐饮公司打电话时接听并让他们进入场地。其他一切，包括账单，都是提前处理好的，所以志愿者可能需要做的唯一额外事情就是带领餐饮公司的人员到他们需要去的地方，”* Saebi说。

Once the menu is decided, make it known to attendees when and where the food is, and what’s on the various available menus. If you’re not serving lunch or dinner, offer a list of nearby restaurants and cafes so attendees can easily see their options.

一旦菜单确定下来，要让与会者知道食物的供应时间和地点，以及各种菜单上都有什么。如果不提供午餐或晚餐，则应提供一份附近餐馆和咖啡馆的名单，以便与会者查看他们的可选项。

Food and drinks for evening events must also be based on a range of dietary restrictions. Mixers can rely on light appetizers only while dinners may contain several courses and menu options. Dining and drinking venues within walking distance of the event venue or hotels generally work best as it simplifies transportation issues.  

晚间活动的食物和饮品也必须符合各种饮食限制。社交聚会可以只提供清淡的开胃菜，而晚宴则可能包含多道菜肴和菜单选项。距离活动地点或酒店步行即可到达的餐饮场所通常效果最佳，因为这样可以简化交通问题。

However, the pandemic may have permanently changed how food is served in future physical events, at least during the event itself.

然而，疫情可能永久性地改变了未来线下活动中食品的供应方式，至少在活动期间是如此。

*"Communal food may shift to grab-and-go, pre-packed boxes moving forward instead of buffets,"* said Cruz.

*“公共食品可能会从自助餐转变为即拿即走、预先包装好的盒装食品，”* Cruz说。 

In virtual events, food and drink are choices made by the individual attendee. The alternative is to offer digital credits with food delivery apps so attendees can have a meal or respite together in a casual Zoom or other platform networking room.

在线上活动中，食物和饮品是由每位参会者自己选择的。另一种方案是提供送餐应用的数字积分，这样参会者可以在Zoom或其他平台的休闲网络会议室中一起用餐或休息。

**Followups**

**活动后续跟进**

While patterns were set, trends made, and playbooks refined before the pandemic, everything was upended after the pandemic hit and will likely change again once the pandemic subsides. This makes followup evaluations all the more crucial in adapting and improving the function, performance, and attendance in future events.

虽然在疫情之前已经确定了模式，形成了趋势，并完善了游戏规则，但疫情爆发后一切都被颠覆，并且一旦疫情消退，一切可能再次发生变化。这使得后续评估对于调整和改进未来活动的功能、表现和参与度方面变得更加重要。

Post-event surveys are a steadfast measure on everything from speaker performance to event relevance and the general enjoyment factor. Typically, the results are used by organizers for future event planning, but not always. Positive remarks are often shared with the speakers who earned them. And positive comments about the event are often used in marketing materials for future versions of the same event.

活动后调查是衡量演讲者表现、活动相关性和总体愉悦程度的可靠标准。通常，组织者会将调查结果用于今后的活动规划，但并不总是如此。积极的评价通常会分享给获得这些评价的演讲者。而有关活动的正面评论则通常会被用于未来同类活动的营销材料中。 

Further, snippets or full videos of speakers are sometimes shared with speakers for inclusion in their own work portfolios, on YouTube, and to market future events.

此外，演讲者的演讲片段或完整视频有时也会分享给他们，用于其个人作品集、YouTube以及推广未来的活动。

Comcast, like many companies, has a tight policy around making and sharing videos of speakers at events. Speaker consent is one of the top requirements. Costs are another determining factor. Even so, videos are only shared internally with "strict guard rails around anything requiring legal compliance."

与许多公司一样，Comcast 对制作和分享活动中演讲者的视频有严格的规定。征得演讲者同意是首要条件之一。成本是另一个决定因素。即便如此，鉴于“对任何需要法律合规的内容都有严格的管控措施”，视频也只在内部共享。

*"If the venue has AV options and if they are not that expensive, we'll ask them to record it and then we can post it on our open source program office website. We’ve also recorded some ourselves, taken pictures ourselves, and hired a photographer sometimes as well,"* said Saebi.

*“如果会场有音视频设备且费用不高，我们会请他们录制，然后发布在我们的开源项目办公室网站上。我们也自己录制过一些内容，自己拍过照片，有时也会聘请摄影师，”* Saebi说。 

Following up to thank the volunteers is also essential. Consider sending thank you cards and notes, or even small gifts. Adding the results of their efforts- such as growth in attendance or accolades from attendees -- to the thank you notes is also a good touch.

后续感谢志愿者也很重要。可以考虑寄送感谢卡和感谢信，甚至是小礼物。在感谢信中加上他们努力的成果，如出席人数的增长或与会者的赞誉，也是不错的做法。 

Followup activities can also be used to extend the experience between events and encourage further engagement.

后续活动还可以用于在活动之间延续体验并鼓励进一步的参与。

*"We do try to make sure that people leave with something tangible to do. For example, we may make some suggestions on how attendees can find a project to work on after the event, such as after Tech Talks, the Open Source Tech Talks and the volunteer events,"* said Simmons.  *“We also suggest places to go to get support. Ultimately, we want to make sure they feel strong and empowered coming out of those events.”*

*“我们会尽量确保人们离开时有一些实实在在的事情可以做。例如，我们可能会针对与会者在活动结束后如何找到一个项目来开展工作提供一些建议，比如之后的技术讲座、开源技术讲座和志愿者活动，”* Simmons说，*“我们还建议了一些寻求支持的地方。最终，我们希望确保他们在这些活动后感到强大和充满力量。”*

There are also followup activities that can help your brand benefit from its efforts in providing useful events.

还有一些后续活动可以帮助你的品牌从提供有用的活动中受益。

*"We're very careful about not spamming people but we do send one email that offers more information on different points of interest with links to our Open Source page, our blog, highlights from the booth, and information about any demos that we shared for any of the external events,"* said Arvin.

*“我们非常小心，不会向人们发送垃圾邮件，但我们会发送一封电子邮件，提供更多关于不同兴趣点的信息，并附上我们开源页面、博客、展位亮点以及我们在任何外部活动中分享的演示信息的链接，”* Arvin说。

## Marketing an open source event

## 开源活动营销宣传

Marketing is the key to success for any event, regardless of venue. Marketing tactics will vary according to size and type of event and the goals the organizers intend to achieve.

营销是任何活动成功的关键，无论活动地点在哪里。营销策略会根据活动的规模、类型以及组织者希望达成的目标而有所不同。

However, below are some marketing tips, strategies, and tactics that tend to work out well for many events.

但是，以下是一些对许多活动来说都效果良好的营销技巧、策略和战术。 

**1) Leverage social media:** Publicize events on social media channels because messages there can be shared more broadly than to the number of people you have on a mailing list. Consider buying ads on Google, Facebook, and others too.

**1） 利用好社交媒体：** 在社交媒体渠道上宣传活动，因为与邮件列表中的人数相比，社交媒体渠道上的信息分享可以覆盖更多人群。还可以考虑在Google、Facebook等平台上购买广告。 

**2) Email campaigns work well:** Mailing lists fuel email campaigns. When cultivated and maintained carefully mailing lists can extend the reach beyond the lists of attendees from past events. Typically, the email schedule for a n email campaign is:

 **2) 电子邮件宣传效果很好：** 邮件列表是电子邮件宣传的助推器。只要精心培养和维护，邮件列表的覆盖范围就能超越以往活动的与会者名单。通常，N次电子邮件宣传的时间表如下：

a.     Announce an upcoming event

a. 宣布即将举行的活动

b.     Push for submissions

b. 推送议题申请消息

c.      Reminder for the approaching deadline for submissions

c. 提醒议题申请截止日期即将到来

d.     Announce the keynotes

d. 公布主题演讲

e.     Announce the event schedule

e. 公布活动日程

f.     Communicate highlights of various aspects of the event

f. 传达活动各方面的亮点

g.     Communicate opportunities for networking, socializing, and nearby attractions

g. 告知建立人脉、社交的机会和附近景点

h.     Event followup emails

h. 活动后续跟进邮件 

**3) Lean in on the power of word of mouth:** Reach out to open source communities who will have an affinity for the topic or the event and to local open source groups to spread the word, help build audience numbers, and attract volunteers.

**3) 借助口碑的力量：** 联系对该主题或活动有兴趣的开源社区和当地开源团体，传播信息，帮助增加观众人数，吸引志愿者。 

*"If you're in, for example, Austin and you're holding a local event for primarily the Austin open-source community, there are a ton of companies locally that you can reach out to. Whether that is companies like Home Depot or IBM that have big open-source development centers there, or whether it's reaching out to the local tech and open-source organizations of which there are a lot,"* said Brown.

*“举例来说，如果你在奥斯汀，并主要为奥斯汀的开源社区举办本地活动，那么你可以联系到许多本地的公司。不管是像Home Depot或IBM这样在当地拥有大型开源开发中心的公司，还是当地的技术和开源组织，都有很多可以联系的对象，”* Brown说。

**4) Create media partnerships:** Ideas on ways to leverage media partnerships include being added to their calendar of events, an exchange of results or services, advertise their and your events on the respective websites, ask for press coverage of the event for additional promotion for it, develop educational opportunities for the community, and other mutually beneficial activities that grow both audiences.

**4) 建立媒体合作伙伴关系：** 利用媒体合作伙伴关系的方式包括将活动添加到他们的活动日历中，交换结果或服务，在各自网站上宣传他们和你的活动，请求媒体对活动进行报道以增加宣传，为社区提供教育机会，以及其他能增加双方受众的互利活动。

**5) Cross-promote two or more events:** *"I met with the team that runs our engineering Tech Talks and asked for their assistance ahead of time. They put it on all of the channels where they promote their Tech Talks. Anything basically where they announce and promote upcoming events, they included my event as if it were one of their Tech Talks. But then we had to narrow it down some since they have quite a large following who are interested in other things,"* said Arvin.

**5) 交叉推广两个或多个活动：** *“我见了负责我们工程技术讲座的团队，并提前请求他们的协助。他们将我的活动放在所有推广他们技术讲座的渠道上。基本上，任何他们宣布和推广即将举行的活动的地方，他们都包括了我的活动，就好像这是他们的技术讲座之一。但后来我们不得不缩小范围，因为他们有相当多的追随者对其他事情感兴趣，”* Arvin说。

**6) Target open source groups:** Post announcements and information on places such as the Open Source back channel and the Open Source chatter, which is to say your intranet system. Also, tag various Open Source specific projects, for example, The Python Group. Further, ask speakers to share it with their teams, their chatter page and their Slack group as well.

**6）针对开源人群：** 在开源后台频道和开源聊天频道等地方发布活动公告和信息，也就是你的 Intranet 内部网络。同时，给各种特定的开源项目打标签，例如Python Group。此外，请求演讲者在他们的团队、聊天页面和Slack群组中分享这些信息。

However you choose to market your event, be assured that the appetite for more information and more opportunities to network has never waned despite current circumstances and challenges.

无论你选择如何推广你的活动，请放心，尽管当前形势严峻，但人们对更多信息和更多交流机会的渴望从未减弱。

## Lessons Learned

## 经验教训

To the credit of the TODO group, open source communities and organizations, and open source fans, events have continued on despite the challenges. It’s only natural that such an open group would open source the lessons learned so far too:

得益于TODO小组、开源社区和组织以及开源粉丝们的努力，尽管面临挑战，开源活动仍在持续进行。这样的开放团体自然会开源迄今为止的经验教训：

**1) Project sprints are increasingly of interest:** Sprints for projects are becoming increasingly popular. For example, a sprint for The Python Language is common at Python conferences. Typically, there are several days of sprints. Some are designed to accelerate headway from people who are core to the project while they are in the same physical space with each other. But some are onramps for new contributors, keeping a vital pipeline filled. And some are introductory and ideal for newcomers.

**1) 项目冲刺越来越受到关注：** 项目冲刺变得越来越受欢迎。例如，在Python会议上，Python语言的冲刺活动就很常见。通常，冲刺会持续数天。一些冲刺旨在让项目核心成员在同一物理空间内加快进展。但有些冲刺是为新贡献者提供的入门渠道，保持重要的后备力量。还有一些是入门性质的，非常适合新人。

Consider using sprints as satellite events to your conference to build feeders for projects and languages you support and need support in. But be forewarned, it is not as easy to do as it sounds.

可以考虑将冲刺阶段作为会议的卫星活动，为你支持和需要支持的项目和语言提供支持。但请注意，这并不像听起来那么容易。

*"We tried and didn't work as well because Salesforce has so many different programming languages, and every team is using a different one. When we tried to make it too specific events, even those outside of Open Source, generally aren't as successful internally. The lesson is that sprints and events can be too narrow,"* said Arvin.

*“我们尝试过，但效果不佳，因为Salesforce有太多不同的编程语言，每个团队都在使用不同的语言。当我们试图把它做得太具体时，即使是那些开源以外的活动，在内部一般也不会那么成功。我们得到的教训是，冲刺和活动的范围可能太窄，”* Arvin说。

**2) One day conferences tend to be a hit:** Take for example, Salesforce’s one day event planned for 50 people in San Francisco at an offsite venue. that we held it at. More than 50 people showed up and stayed the entire day. The talks were by Salesforce and other companies. Marketing was mostly grassroots with most of the messaging targeting the local community and inviting local speakers.

**2）一天的会议往往很受欢迎：** 例如，Salesforce计划在旧金山一个外部场地举办一天活动，计划招募50人。结果超过50人到场并待了一整天。演讲由Salesforce和其他公司提供。营销主要是草根方式，大部分消息传递都针对本地社区并邀请本地演讲者。

*"It ended up being a huge success. We had really positive feedback around it and people stayed the whole day. It is always a win when you don't lose people halfway through the event,"* said Arvin.

*“活动最终取得了巨大成功。我们得到了非常积极的反馈，人们一整天都没有离开。当你没有在活动中途失去人群时，这总是一个胜利，”* Arvin说。 

**3) Maintain bonds for your projects:** Did you lose your maintainer or are they about to leave to work somewhere else?  Project contributors are bound to have a lot of questions you’ll need to answer to keep momentum going.  

**3) 维护项目的纽带：** 你是否失去了你的维护者，或者他们是否即将离开去其他地方工作？项目的贡献者肯定会有很多问题需要你来回答，以保持进展。 

*"I think it's important to call that out. And not just in the sense of the specific instance and how that ended up being useful for the project because we had the maintainer who was moving on. But because I think that speaks to a broader theme of the importance of events,"* said Simmons.  

*“我认为指出这一点很重要，这不仅仅是指具体的事例，也不仅仅是指因为我们有维护者一直在推进相关工作，所以这对项目最终是有用的。而是因为这反映了活动重要性的一个更广泛的主题，”* Simmons 说。 

"Especially when there's change coming with a project. Whether that's a change in the leadership or change in how it's organized, or a big new release. There are communities that have formed organically around these projects and everybody has their own stake and sense of ownership. So when a project hits a point where there's something big happening, that raises a lot of questions for other participants. Events can be an extremely useful forum for helping people address the fear of the uncertainty and organize around what's coming next," Simmons added.

*“特别是当项目发生变化时。无论是领导层的变化，组织方式的变化，还是重大新版本的发布。围绕这些项目自发形成了社区，每个人都有自己的利益和归属感。所以当项目遇到重大变化时，这会引发其他参与者的许多问题。活动可以成为帮助人们应对不确定性并组织下一步行动的极好平台，”* Simmons补充道。

**4) Pivot whenever and wherever you need to:** It’s ok to pivot. Especially now when everyone is focused on adapting to a new reality. Don’t hesitate. Pivot and move on is the new fail fast.

**4) 需要时随时随地调整：** 调整是正常的。尤其是现在，每个人都在专注于适应新的现实。不要犹豫，调整和继续前进是新的快速试错法则。 

"If you're not getting traction, or you're not getting support from the organization, or the content is off or you can’t find good speakers, or whatever the case may be that points to a likely fail for the event you had in mind, then pivot. If you're not getting support it doesn't mean it's not an important event, or that it doesn't need to happen. It just means it isn’t working right now," said Arvin.

“如果你没有获得关注，或者没有得到组织的支持，或者内容不对，或者找不到好的演讲者，或者无论是什么情况表明你计划的活动可能会失败，那就调整。如果你没有得到支持，这并不意味着这不是一个重要的活动，或者不需要举办。这只说明现在它暂时行不通，”Arvin 说。

"It's okay if the end result doesn't look like the original event you had in mind. It can evolve throughout the process. And even with successful events that we've done in the past, the second one is going to look different and so is the third and fourth. We’re always going to be changing and adapting. And that's okay," Arvin added.

“如果最终结果与你最初设想的活动不一样，也没关系。它可以在整个过程中不断演变。即使是我们过去成功举办过的活动，第二次也会有所不同，第三次和第四次更是如此。我们总是在不断变化和适应。这是正常的，”Arvin补充到。

**5) Curate documentation to encourage event spread:**. For example, Salesforce curates documentation on how to guides and other material on events so that smaller groups can run events on their own. Salesforce is also looking at open sourcing some of these documents to the larger community as well. But event organizers still are standing by to give advice and otherwise assist as needed.

**5) 整理文档，鼓励活动传播：** 例如，Salesforce整理了关于如何开展活动的指南和其他资料，以便小型团体可以自行举办活动。Salesforce还在考虑向更大的社区开源其中的一些文档。但活动组织者仍会随时提供建议，并在需要时提供其他帮助。 

"I'm both a web developer and a community organizer and one of the things that I have come to learn, and I wish I had realized this earlier, was how hungry communities are for this kind of support," said Simmons.

“我既是web开发者也是社区组织者，有一个我逐渐了解并后悔没能早一点知晓的事情，就是开源社区非常需要这类帮助，”Simmons说。

"Communities may not even know that they need support from event planners and organizers. But when we show up and we offer our support, I think they quickly realize that events are just as complicated in software but in very different ways. Then they are eager to be here to work with us," said Simmons.

“社区可能根本不知道他们需要活动策划者和组织者的支持。但当我们出现并提供支持时，我想他们很快就会意识到，活动与软件一样复杂，但方式却截然不同。然后他们就会迫不及待地来与我们合作，”Simmons说。

**6) Blended events will be the new virtual:** Virtual events were forced to scale on the heels of a pandemic. But they are likely with us forever now, either in their pure state or as part of new, blended events. 

**6) 混合活动将成为新的线上活动：** 线上活动因疫情而被迫规模增长。但它们可能会一直存在，无论是纯粹的线上活动，还是作为新的混合活动的一部分。

One of the biggest advantages to virtual events is scale: organizers can reach much larger audiences located anywhere with an internet connection. That’s great because one of the biggest goals in open source is to grow communities and projects. 

线上活动的最大优势之一是规模：组织者可以接触到更多的受众，他们可以在任何地方，只需要有互联网连接。这很好，因为开源的最大目标之一就是发展社区和项目。

*"We need to get more people trained to be the next generation of developers. Frankly we're in need of more developers now. And it's not just developers, right? It's community leaders, it's program office managers, as every company is now going to open-source as the norm, we all know that there are a ton of things that go along with that. Legal and compliance and governance and all of these things,"* said Brown.

*“我们需要让更多的人接受培训，成为下一代开发者。坦率地说，我们现在需要更多的开发者。而且不仅仅是开发者，对吧？是社区领导者，是项目办公室经理，随着每家公司现在都将开源作为常态，我们都知道还有很多事情需要处理。法律、合规和治理等等，”* Brown说。

Virtual events are a great growth facilitator. They also enable organizers to produce an event for less money and attendees to spend less money to attend. But that’s not to say that virtual events can out deliver physical events on every important touchstone.

线上活动是极好的增长促进器。它们还能让组织者花更少的钱举办活动，让参会者花更少的钱参加活动。但这并不意味着线上活动可以在每个重要方面都超过实体活动。

*"When we look forward, now, we're seeing a strong opportunity for something hybrid. Where we can use the virtual side to bring something to a much larger group of people. That's going to provide a huge impact and benefit for attendees and hopefully help them through their careers and into the open-source community,"* Brown said.

*“展望未来，现在我们看到混合活动的巨大机遇。我们可以利用虚拟技术为更多的人提供服务。这将为参会者提供巨大的影响和利益，希望能帮助他们通过职业生涯并进入开源社区，”* Brown 说。

**So, what might a hybrid event look like?**

**那么，混合活动会是什么样的呢？**

*"We'll start with the virtual event and move over to our physical event, which is great, because we don't want our physical events to be an echo chamber. We've seen value come out of virtual and physical events, which is the silver lining of how we can use the virtual events to expand the region of the physical one in a hybrid model,"* said Brown.

*“我们将从线上活动开始，然后转向我们的线下活动，这是非常好的，因为我们不希望我们的线下活动成为只有一种声音的回音室。我们已经看到线上和线下活动带来的价值，这是我们在混合模式中利用线上活动来扩展线下活动范围的一线希望，”* Brown说。

At the end of the day, events are living things, growing and dying, adapting and evolving through the years. Technologies change, audiences change, circumstances change, the needs of the event change, economics or pandemic changes, lots of things will always be shaping and reshaping how open source events are done. Accordingly, this document is also a living thing. Please check back regularly for updates.

归根结底，活动是有生命的东西，在岁月的长河中成长、消亡、适应和发展。技术在变、受众在变、环境在变、活动的需求在变、经济或流行病在变，很多事情都会影响和重塑开源活动的方式。因此，本文档也是一个有生命的东西。请定期回来查看更新。
