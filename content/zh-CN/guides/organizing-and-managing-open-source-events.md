标题: 组织与管理开源活动
---

Open source events are popular as much for the networking opportunities as for the skill building exercises and knowledge sharing. Events run the gamut from single focused internal talks and multitrack corporate external events to the international conferences. While decades of experience shape these events, today a global pandemic is driving a hard shift from physical to virtual venues. The change is likely permanent as virtual venues are unlikely to disappear once the novel coronavirus is curtailed or conquered. There are already hints that the future will see a rise of hybrid versions.
开源活动因其提供的社交机会、技能建设和知识分享而广受欢迎。开源活动有许多形式，包括单一聚焦的内部讲座、企业多方向外部活动。到各类国际会议。尽管这些开源活动是由几十年的经验塑造的，但当下的全球疫情正在推动活动形式从实体场所向虚拟场所的刚性转变。这种变化很可能是永久的，即使新冠病毒得到控制或消除，虚拟场所也不太可能消失。已经有迹象表明，未来将会出现线上线下混合的开源活动。

Behind all of these events is an OSPO or small events team managing the details, gathering speakers and volunteers, promoting the benefits, and calling open source fans to attend. Those responsible are invisible when all goes right and wishing they were if things go wrong. In short, event management can be a thankless job. Through it all, they make everything happen no matter what minor glitches or major pandemics might plague them along the way.
在所有这些活动的背后，都有一个开源项目办公室（OSPO）或一个小型活动团队在管理细节，聚集演讲者和志愿者，推广开源收益，并召集开源爱好者参加。当一切开源活动顺利进行时，OSPO或活动团队的负责人是隐身幕后的，而如果出了问题，他们会希望自己也是在幕后的。简而言之，开源活动管理可能是一项不被感谢的工作。尽管如此，无论开源活动管理者遇到什么小问题或大型疫情，他们都会让各种开源活动蓬勃发生。

The purpose of this guide is to help OSPOs and open source event team members pull off successful open source events through the sharing of experience and resources of those who have done so before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. This guide is meant to be a living document in that it is expected to be updated as the challenges of this time continue to unfold new obstacles and opportunities for event managers.
本指南的目的是帮助OSPO和开源活动团队成员，通过分享在新冠疫情之前和期间管理开源活动的经验和资源，让开源活动能继续成功举办。本指南旨在成为一份持续更新的活跃文档，把当下的挑战延伸到新的阻碍点和机遇，供开源活动管理者参考。

## Intro
## 开源活动介绍

Open source events are educational and networking hubs for the benefit of specific or at-large open source communities. Whether intimate or gigantic, these events are essential to the growth of the open source movement, of individual careers and professional reputations, and the growth of specific open source projects.
开源活动是特定或大型开源社区的教育和社交中心。无论规模大小，这些活动对于开源运动的发展、个人职业生涯和行业声誉的提升，以及特定开源项目的增长都至关重要。

It is easy to think of open source events as similar to planning, organizing and promoting other technology events. While there are some similarities overall, open source events are in a category of their own.  
开源活动很容易和其他技术活动的规划、组织和推广做类比。虽然总体上有一些相似之处，但开源活动实际上是属于自身特有的一个类别。

> "Honestly, there are a lot of differences. A traditional tech event is more about strategic alliances and partnerships and how can you help me and how can I help you, but all for more of a capitalistic purpose, as it were," – Angela Brown, senior vice president and General Manager of Events at [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).
> “坦白说，有很多不同之处。传统的技术活动更多的是关于战略联盟和合作关系，以及你如何能帮助我，我如何能帮助你，但所有这些更多是出于资本主义经济的目的。”—— Angela Brown 活动高级副总裁兼总经理，[Linux基金会](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)。

*"By its very nature, the open-source community is deeply passionate about what they do, and very passionate about open-source. That passion extends into everything,"* - added Brown, who has worked on tech events for other companies since 1994. She joined the Linux Foundation in 2007 after the organization arose from the merger of the previous open-source Development Labs and Free Standards Group. Linux Foundation events began to take shape almost immediately.
"就其本质而言，开源社区对他们所做的事情，以及对开源本身，都有深深的热情。这种热情延伸到一切之中。" - Brown补充到。自1994年以来，她在其他公司为技术活动工作。她于2007年加入Linux基金会，基金会是由开源开发实验室和自由标准组织合并后建立，其下的开源活动立即就开始形成。

It is easy to think of open source events as similar to planning, organizing and promoting other technology events. While there are some similarities overall, open source events are in a category of their own.
我们很容易将开源活动与规划、组织和推广其他技术活动相类比。虽然总体上有一些相似之处，但开源活动实际上是属于自己的一个类别。

"Honestly, there are a lot of differences. A traditional tech event is more about strategic alliances and partnerships and how can you help me and how can I help you, but all for more of a capitalistic purpose, as it were," – Angela Brown, senior vice president and General Manager of Events at [the Linux Foundation]
“坦白说，有很多不同之处。传统的技术活动更多的是关于战略联盟和伙伴关系，以及你如何能帮助我，我如何能帮助你，但所有这些都更多的是出于资本主义的目的。”—— Angela Brown，[Linux基金会]的活动高级副总裁兼总经理。

"By its very nature, the open-source community is deeply passionate about what they do, and very passionate about open-source. That passion extends into everything,"* - added Brown, who has worked on tech events for other companies since 1994. She joined the Linux Foundation in 2007 after the organization arose from the merger of the previous open-source Development Labs and Free Standards Group. Linux Foundation events began to take shape almost immediately.
"就其本质而言，开源社区对他们所做的事情，以及对开源本身，都有深深的热情。这种热情延伸到一切之中。" - Brown补充到。自1994年以来，她在其他公司为技术活动工作。在开源开发实验室和自由标准组合并后形成的Linux基金会中，她于2007年加入。Linux基金会的活动几乎立即开始形成。

The good news is there is a long laundry list of event management skills that are easily transferable from tech events to open source events. However, failing to keep key differences in mind can set your event up for failure from the start.
好消息是，从技术活动转向开源活动，有一长串的活动管理技能可以便利引入。然而，若忽视技术活动和开源活动的关键差异，可能会使你的开源活动从一开始就注定失败。

*"When you realize what those motivations are, it does infer and change how you are actually going to create an event,"* - Brown explained.
*"当你了解到这些动机是什么时，它确实会引导并改变你如何真实地创建活动"* - Brown解释说。

Those motivation differences also create some interesting, and often misunderstood conference feedback.
动机之间的差异也会带来有趣和常常会被误解的活动反馈。

For one thing, open source programmers are passionate so they are quick to approach organizers at conferences to report what’s wrong or what could be improved. These encounters can sound like harsh judgments and complaints, but they usually are not.
举个例子，开源程序员会非常积极，他们会很快联系开源活动组织者告知发生了什么差错或需要改进，这些情况好像有点像苛刻的批评或抱怨，但通常并非如此。

*"It’s what they do: find bugs and fix them. That's how we can iterate and make events better. It doesn't mean that people don't actually enjoy the events, but it definitely was funny. I had a hard time with that at the beginning,"* - laughs Brown.
*"这就是他们的工作：找出错误并修复它们。这就是我们如何迭代并改进开源活动的方式。这并不意味着人们不喜欢这些活动，但这确实很有趣。我刚开始时对此有点困惑。"* Brown笑着说。

There are marked differences in OSPO and event teams charged with supporting open source as well. Team history, skill sets, and aims and goals can vary widely.
不同OSPO和开源支撑团队之间的差异有被记录下来，团队历史、技能情况、开源活动目标等会有广泛的差异。

Most open source event organizers have funny tales and war stories to share. But not all of them came to the task by the same path. Some, like the Salesforce team, picked up the responsibility just before a pandemic locked them down.
大多数开源活动组织者会分享有趣和战斗的故事。这些故事会有不同的发生路径，例如Saleforce团队，他们在因新冠疫情的封锁之前紧急认领了开源活动的任务。

*"In the world of open source we want to make sure people know we’re just starting to dip our toes into these events that are very specific to open source, but we have done quite a few,"* - said Alyssa Arvin who worked in engineering marketing at Salesforce for seven years before moving to [its OSPO](https://opensource.salesforce.com/) in December – roughly a month before the novel coronavirus went viral on a pandemic scale.
*"在开源世界中，我们希望让人们知道我们刚刚开始涉足这些非常特定的开源活动，但我们已经完成了相当多的工作。"* - Alyssa Arvin说，她在Salesforce公司的工程营销部门工作了七年，然后在新冠疫情全球爆发前一个月的的12月份，转到了该公司的[OSPO](https://opensource.salesforce.com/)开源办公室。
 

## Open source event types
## 开源活动类型

There are four general categories for open source events. The first two are determined by venue: physical or virtual. The remaining two are determined by audience: internal (company employees and partners) or external (open to people employed outside of the event organizer).
开源活动总体上分为四类。前两类由场地区分：线下和线上。剩下两类由参与者区分：内部参与（公司员工和合作伙伴）和外部参与（向开源活动企业以外的人员开放）。

Event types can also be categorized by purpose or goal.
开源活动类型也可以用活动目的来区分。
 

> "There are events that we're doing to cultivate a community internally. There are events that we're trying to do to appreciate the external communities that we rely on. And then there are the events that we're doing to support the Open Source Projects that come out of Salesforce" – Joshua Simmons, formerly a senior strategist in Salesforce’s OSPO.
"我们有些开源活动是为了培育内部社区。我们正在尝试的活动还包括答谢我们依赖的外部社区。以及，我们还有支持从Salesforce走出去的开源项目而举行开源活动" - Joshua Simmons，Salesforce公司前OSPO的高级策略师。

Many organizations have experience in conducting open source events in physical venues, whether those are onsite or off, or for an internal or external audience.
很多机构会组织线下场所的开源活动，其类型包括在自身办公楼内部或办公楼之外、只有机构内部人员参与或有外部人员参与。

> "The process is pretty similar for internal and external events, other than the marketing piece," – Shilla Saebi, Open Source Program Manager at [Comcast](https://comcast.github.io/).
> “内部人员参与和有外部人员参与的开源活动，其组织流程非常相似，和营销类活动不同。” - Shilla Saebi，[Comcast](https://comcast.github.io/)公司开源项目经理。

However, virtual events are significantly different and completely new to many organizations who soon discovered they would need to learn how on the fly.
然而，线上的开源活动会有显著差异，对许多机构来说是全新经历，它们需要学习如何经营。

> "Physical events and virtual events have different advantages and limitations. Physical events can create an in-person emotional experience but not everyone in the world is able to attend due to location or related travel cost. On the other hand, virtual events are scalable. They have an easy entry point," – Teresa Terasaki, Brand Experience & Events and Program Manager, Open Source Community at [Google Open Source].
> "线下和线上活动有各自的优点和局限性。线下活动可以带来私人的情感体验，但由于地点或旅行成本，不是全世界每个人都能参加。另一方面，线上活动是可扩展的。它们具有便利入口。" - Teresa Terasaki，[Google开源社区](https://opensource.google/)品牌体验和活动及项目经理。

Among the main advantages to a physical event are the social interactions, networking opportunities and a new environment in which to spur innovation and collaboration with others. These happen to also be the greatest weaknesses in virtual events.
线下活动的主要优点包括社交互动、建立交际网络，以及激发创新和他人合作的新环境。这些恰好也是线上活动的最大弱点。

Among the main advantages of a virtual event are increased safety during a pandemic, scalability, affordability, accessibility, and no travel or other associated costs. But virtual events have downsides too.
线上活动的主要优点包括疫情期间的安全性、可扩展性、可承受的活动成本、可访问性、无旅行相关开支等。但线上活动也有不足。

> "In recent months, we’ve seen a significant increase in participation at virtual events. Virtual events are able to reach new geographies and enable people who wouldn’t normally be able to join to attend traditional, in-person events. But they aren’t able to provide intensive in-person experience like physical events do," – María Cruz, Program Manager, Community Engagement at [Google](https://opensource.google/).
> "近几个月，我们看到线上活动的参与度显著增加。线上活动能够覆盖新的地理区域，使通常无法参加传统现场活动的人有机会参与。但是，它们无法提供像线下活动那样的深度现场体验。" - María Cruz，[Google开源社区](https://opensource.google/)项目经理和社区参与人员。

Beyond these general categories, are myriad subcategories of event types. Most are determined by topic, but others are categorized by time or intensity.
在这些常见开源活动类别之外，还有许许多多更细分的活动类型。主要通过活动主题区分，也有通过举办时长和活动密集度来区分。

*"Events like sprints for projects come to mind. For example, sprints on the Python language orbit around every Python conference. They hold several days of sprints, both for people who are core to the project to make headway while they have the good fortune of being in the same physical space with each other. But also, as an onramp to new contributors,"* said Josh Simmons, former open source strategist for [Salesforce](https://opensource.salesforce.com/). He also previously served as President of Salesforce’s Open Source Initiative.
*"我想到的开源活动就是为开源项目进行的敏捷冲刺。例如，围绕每一次Python会议都会有关于Python语言的敏捷冲刺。在为期数天的敏捷冲刺中，既能让开源项目关键人物非常难得地在同一实体空间共同协作取得进展。同时也让新贡献者找到切入点。"* [Salesforce](https://opensource.salesforce.com/)的前开源策略师Josh Simmons说。他之前还担任过Salesforce的开源倡议的主席。

*"Sprints are going to be an important one to look into at some point. You might want to make sure it's on your radar."*
*“敏捷冲刺将是你在某个时刻需要关注的重要事项。你可能需要确保它在你的关注范围内”*

Regardless of the type of open source event you’re currently planning, virtual will reign supreme in venues for as long as the pandemic lasts and will probably remain a strong option afterwards. While most organizations are learning how to host a virtual event on the fly, shared experiences are beginning to reveal some good guidance.
无论你当前正在筹划的开源活动是何种类型，只要疫情持续，线上活动将在场地选择上占据主导地位，并可能在之后仍然是一个强有力的选项。大多数机构正在学习如何组织线上开源活动，共享的活动经验将会带来良好指引。

## 4 key elements in virtual open source events
## 线上开源活动的四个关键元素

Pivoting to virtual open source events is a smart and natural move during the Covid-19 pandemic. But that is not to say it was an easy move to make.
新冠疫情期间的开源活动需要有智能化和自然顺畅的转型，这不是一件容易的事情。

*"First we had to negotiate out of all of the contracts we had this year. It was a lot to contend with because if a local government bans large gatherings, for example, then you've got force majeure in your favor. But just being in a pandemic doesn't free you from the contract,"* said Brown.
*“首先，我们必须退出今年我们签订的所有开源活动合同。这涉及很多艰难工作，举例说地方政府禁止大型集会，那么你就有了受制于不可抗力的理由。但是，仅仅因为处于新冠疫情之中，并不能让你免于履行合同。”* Brown说到。

*"It quickly then became necessary to research virtual event platforms and try to figure out which ones really meet our needs. But perhaps the biggest challenge was in rolling those out and trying to create the same type of attendee experience as in physical events, which to be quite honest, you can't create the same thing. Right? So, you move on to planning an entirely new and hopefully just as engaging experience,"* Brown added.
*"很快，我们就必须开始研究线上活动平台，并试图找出哪些平台真正满足我们的需求。但可能最大的挑战在于推出这些线上活动，并试图创造与线下活动相同类型的参与体验，坦白说，你无法创造出完全相同的体验，对吧？所以，你需要转向规划一种全新的，希望同样吸引人的体验。"* Brown补充到。

But the stress endured by teams scrambling to make virtual work is not for naught.
但是，努力组织线上开源活动的团队其经受的压力并非毫无价值。

*"This is an opportunity to think outside the box including platform, format, content, timing, and interactivity. We can also reach audience groups that you don’t normally reach at in-person events,"* said Terasaki.
*“这是一个跳出固有框架来思考的机会，包括平台、形式、内容、时机以及互动性。我们还能触及那些在线下面对面活动中通常难以接触到的受众群体。”* - Terasaki 指出。

Teams should get comfortable with planning open source events as they’re likely to still be in use far after the pandemic rush subsides. However, virtual events are also likely to evolve.
开源活动组织团队应该习惯活动策划工作，它们将会在疫情消退后仍长期持续。但是线上活动可能会发生演变。

*"Considering the level of innovation in accessibility for remote participation, and the positive impact it has on the event’s reach, there is a chance that events transform to a hybrid format. This would imply that an event can both be in-person and virtual: while some participants will gather in the same venue, there could be a portion of the speakers presenting virtually, with some attendees joining remotely as well,"* said Cruz.
*“考虑到远程便利接入参与的创新水平及其对开源活动覆盖范围产生的积极影响，未来的开源活动有可能转变为混合模式。这意味着一场活动可以同时是线下和线上的：一方面，部分参与者会在同一场地聚集；另一方面，部分演讲者可能通过线上方式展示内容，同时也有部分参会者在线远程参加。”*，Cruz 说。

**Event focus**
**开源活动聚焦点**

Deciding the focus of your event is the first and most important step as it sets the scale, tone, and pace for the rest of the event planning.
决定开源活动的聚焦点是活动组织的第一步也是最重要工作，它设定了开源活动的规模、基调和其他活动规划工作的节奏。

*"First, figure out what your purpose is and why you are gathering people together. Who are you looking to gather together, and how do dates and timing work for that group? There are so many events out there, or there have been so many events out there already. How is yours different and why would people want to attend? These are questions to ask yourself and team,"* says Brown.
*“首先，确定你的目标和召集人们聚集在一起的原因。你希望召集哪些人，以及对于这群人来说，选择什么样的日期和时间最为合适？业界正在举办和曾经举办的活动数不胜数。你的活动有何差异，为何人们想要参加？这些都是你和团队需要回答的问题。”* Brown 说。

In short, make sure you’re bringing an event with value to a group that will value the information.
简而言之，请确保你要举办的活动能为重视这些知识信息的群体带来价值。

Once you know the purpose and the intended audience, you’ll be able to quickly determine other parameters, such as the type of virtual venue technologies you will need.
当你知道开源活动的目的和目标受众，你就能快速决定其他的活动参数，例如线上会场所需的技术形式。

**Funding: registration fees and sponsorships**
**活动经费：报名费和赞助费**

Registration and sponsorship fees are typical funding sources for physical open source events, but these may be harder to muster for virtual events. Traditionally, open source events fare better if registration fees are low as that tends to bring in larger attendance numbers. Sponsorships cover many if not all of the costs at many events, or at least any shortfall from lowering the registration fees.
报名费和赞助费通常是线下开源活动常见的经费来源，但对于线上活动来说，筹集这类费用可能会更加困难。传统上，开源活动若能保持较低的报名费用，则往往能够吸引更多参会者，因为低费用有利于提高参与度。在许多活动中，赞助商提供的赞助可以覆盖大部分甚至全部成本，至少能够弥补因降低报名费而造成的资金缺口。

While many organizers are not seeking to profit from an event, most would like to cover their costs if for no other reason than to offer more events to the community.
虽然很多开源活动组织者不期望从活动中获利，但出于至少能够为社区提供更多活动这一考虑，大多数人都希望能收回成本。

*"A lot of that comes down to why a sponsor would sponsor that event in the first place. That varies. For some events like Linux Kernel Summit, for example, which is annual meeting of 80 to 90 people, where the Linux story evolves, and the core kernel developers sit down and decide what's going to happen with future release cycles. Sponsors pay good money to get a seat at the table at that event. That is really the only benefit they care about,"* says Brown.
*“很多问题归结为赞助商为什么会赞助开源活动。这因情况而异。例如，像Linux Kernel Summit这样的活动，这是一个每年举行的80到90人的会议，在那里，Linux的故事在演进，重要的内核开发人员坐下来决定未来发布周期的内容。赞助商愿意花大价钱在那个活动中获得一个席位。这实际上是他们唯一关心的收益”*，Brown说。

*"Whereas another event like Linux Plumbers Conference attracts developers who are working in all of the core subsystems of the Linux kernel, that so many companies and organizations depend on. A lot of companies sponsor that event, not because of the individual benefits that they find in a sponsorship perspective, but simply because they know it is important to support the community. It benefits everybody. But then you have other events like KubeCon, where it is a lead gen thing,"* Brown added.
*“而像另一个Linux Plumbers Conference活动吸引了在Linux内核所有核心子系统中工作的开发者，这是许多公司和机构所依赖的。许多公司赞助这个活动，不是出于从赞助中获得具体好处，而仅仅是因为他们知道支持社区是重要的。这对每个人都有好处。但是还有像KubeCon这样的其他活动，那里是一个培育潜在客户的场所”*，Brown补充到。

Virtual events incur costs too and organizers must decide whether to pay them or seek funding elsewhere. Consider that given the long dry spell in open source events and conferences, there is pent up demand now among sponsors and open source recruiters who are effectively cut off from much of the open source community. Finding a way to involve sponsors in virtual events helps restore the full circle of open source relationships.
线上开源活动同样会产生成本，组织者必须决定是否自行承担成本，还是寻求其他经费来源。考虑到开源活动和会议经历了长时间的空白期，当前赞助商和开源招聘者中存在因为被切断与开源社区联系而带来的积压需求。寻找一种方式让赞助商参与到线上活动，有助于恢复开源协作关系的运转。

**Code of conduct**
**行为准则**

It comes as no surprise to anyone that a code of conduct is just as imperative for online behavior as it is in real world events. However, your current standby code of conduct may need some revamping to ensure all the virtual bases are covered. Be sure to comb through it carefully before deeming it the official rule of the venue.
人们不会惊讶于线上活动的行为准则和现实世界活动一样重要。然而，你现有的行为准则可能需要一些修订，以确保覆盖所有的线上活动场景，在确认它成为活动场所的正式行为准则前，一定要仔细检查。

*"It's not just about having the code of conduct, it's about knowing how to actually execute on it,"* said Brown.
*“这不仅仅是拥有行为准则，更是如何真正执行这些准则”*，Brown说。

**Diversity**
**多样性**

Diversity outreach is important in efforts aimed at building broader interest and participation in open source and open source projects, and to increase event attendance.
拓展多样性是构建开源项目更广泛的利益方和参与者的重要环节，也能提升开源活动的参与人数。

*"Tech has a representation problem, period. And Open Source requires someone to have volunteer time, basically to contribute. That is sort of the proxy for privilege. So we end up with Open Source having an even bigger diversity in representation problem than tech itself does,"* Simmons said.
*“科技行业毋庸置疑有从业者代表性问题。而开源领域需要有人自愿花时间，基本上是只做贡献，这个是开源领域特权的体现。所以我们认为开源比起科技行业有更迫切的多样化代表性问题”*， Simmons说。

*"We have to do a lot to intentionally overcome that. We proactively look for speakers with name recognition but also if the speaker can be a woman, great. If it can be person of color, all the better. If they can be a gender minority, fantastic. We're trying to both tap into people with name recognition as well as people who can be role models,"* added Simmons.
*“我们必需有意识地做很多工作来克服这个问题。我们积极寻找有知名度的演讲者，但如果演讲者是女性，那非常好。如果是有色人种，那就更好。如果是性别少数群体，那就太棒了。我们在努力吸引知名人士以及可以成为榜样的人物”*，Simmons补充到。



## Finding a theme or event focus
## 找到开源活动主题或焦点

The first step is to determine the theme or focus of the event as that will guide everything that follows in event planning.
开源活动的第一步是决定其主题或焦点，这会引导后续的全部规划。

*"At the core, you have to decide what the purpose is of the event and who you plan on being there. That will in turn define where the event should be, what kind of venue it should be in, what the setup should be, and how you are going to market it,"* said Brown.
*“究其核心，你需要决定开源活动的目标和计划参加的人员，这会反过来影响会议地点和场所的选择，场所的布置，以及你如何进行营销推广”*，Brown说。

Theme and expected attendee size affect the event’s setting and tone. There are events where the purpose is to include and attract more people. Conversely, there are some events where the headcount does not matter, for example, a hackfest or a technical forum. *"At that point, it is really about creating an environment where people can come and all they have to focus on is getting the work done that they came to accomplish with other people. And hopefully having a good time while they are doing it,"* Brown added.
开源活动的主题和预期的参与者规模，会影响活动的设置和基调。有些活动的目的是容纳和吸引更多的人。相反，有些活动并不关注人数，例如黑客马拉松或技术论坛。*“在那种情况下，真正重要的是创造一个环境，人们可以来到这里，他们唯一需要关注的是与其他参与者一起完成工作，也希望他们在过程中享受愉快时光”*，Brown补充说。

However, deciding the purpose of the event can be a tough call. Gauging topic interests can be measured in several ways, but it still may come down to an educated guess. 
然而，确定开源活动的目标是一个困难的事情。评估开源话题的兴趣度有好几种方式，但需要有根据的猜测。

Among other things, Salesforce uses its Volunteer Time Off (VTO) program, which is an internal program focused on giving back to the open source community, to judge event interest.
此外，Saleforce使用志愿者休假（VTO, Volunteer Time Off）的回馈开源社区内部方案，来度量开源活动的兴趣度。

*"So much of this is trial and error. Like all Open Source program offices, we are trying to figure this out. We also try to tie it to exact metrics such as the number of volunteer hours we get. Just to see if this is something that is of interest to people,"* said Alyssa Arvin, Senior Program Manager, Open Source at Salesforce.
*“该方案大部分是用于试错，和所有OSPO开源办公室一样，我们在努力找到解决方案。我们也尝试使用志愿工作小时数作为精准指标，度量人们参与开源活动的兴趣度”*，Saleforce开源项目高级经理Alyssa Arvin说。

For example, if Salesforce aims for 40 people to volunteer at this event and 50 employees sign up, they know interest in the event is high. However, if only 15 employees volunteered then *"okay, this might not be the best event. Or maybe we weren't marketing it correctly. So we adjust our event strategy and plan too. Having metrics helps us find a hit topic or theme for the event,"* said Arvin.
例如，Saleforce计划需要40位志愿者参加开源活动，有50位员工报名，那么就能知道开源活动的兴趣度很高。但若只有15位员工报名，*”那么开源活动的规划可能未到最佳，或者我们没有正确地宣传推广，我们会相应调整其策略和规划。通过度量指标可以帮助我们发现最佳的开源活动主题“,* Arvin说。

Comcast uses polls to narrow their event topics.
Comcast公司使用投票来收窄其开源活动主题。

Saebi says she reaches out to the community with a quick survey or a poll in the Slack channel to ask, *"’Hey, we're thinking about doing a conference. What topics are exciting to you? And then do you also have any speakers that you'd like to recommend?’ All they have to do is choose their top topics from our list."*
Saebi说她会用Slack channel里面的快速调查或投票来访谈开源社区，*“你好，我们想组织一次会议，什么话题会让你感到兴奋，有没推荐的演讲者”，被访谈者需要做的是从我们的主题列表里选择他们最关注的那些*。

Do not be afraid to consider a target audience as an event theme too. A lot of mutual good can come from helping different groups find opportunities and overcome challenges in open source.
不要害怕把目标参与者作为活动主题。在开源世界帮助不同群体发现机遇和克服挑战，会带来参与者和开源世界的相互收益。

*"We have events that focus on our employee resource group. Examples include a project for the LGBT community, one for women in technology, and another called BOLDforce for our Black, African American community. People are really excited and waiting for these events,"* said Arvin.
*“我们举办过聚焦内部员工群体的开源活动。其他例子包括面向LGBT社区、科技行业的女性群体、美国黑人社区的BOLDforce活动等。人们对这些活动非常兴奋和充满期待”*，Arvin说。

Ultimately, the event’s topic or theme is its purpose. Therefore, is must be highly focused and clearly articulated.
归根到底，开源活动的主题就是其目标，需要高度聚焦和清晰表达。

*"Most recently we've been focusing on events aimed at building our internal open source community,"* said Simmons.
*“最近我们聚焦在构建内部开源社区的系列活动”*，Simmons说。

## Choosing a venue
## 选择开源活动场所

Choosing a venue has always been largely driven by strategy than exotic locales.
选择开源活动场地更多是由活动策略决定，而不是异域风情的地点。

*"The Linux Foundation gets a ton of requests to hold events in India, in Africa in different countries in South America, a lot of emerging countries where there's a lot of potential for future open-sourced community members,"* said Brown.
*“Linux基金会收到很多来自印度、非洲、南美洲不同国家的开源活动举办请求，这些新兴国家有很大的未来开源社区拓展可能性”*，Brown说。

*"But there's the economics of it to consider too. Events are not cheap to hold and we can't be everywhere. But we don't want to limit the opportunities or potential from these emerging areas or other areas that we simply can't be in. So we think that virtual events gives us an opportunity to reach a larger, more diverse audience around the world, which is huge,"* Brown explained.
*“但是我们也需要考虑经济因素。举办活动并不便宜，我们不能在每个地方都举办活动。但我们也不想限制这些新兴地区或者我们无法到达地区的机会和潜力。所以，我们认为线上活动给了我们一个机会，让我们能够接触到世界各地更广泛更多元的受众，这是非常重要的优势”*，Brown解释到。

Because of the global pandemic, many event organizers are having to pivot from physical conferences and events to virtual ones. However, an eventual return to events in the physical world are also in the plans, as are budding ideas for hybrid events that blend virtual and physical activities.
由于全球疫情的影响，许多开源活动组织者不得不从线下会议和活动转向线上形式。然而，未来最终回归实体世界举办活动也在计划之中，与此同时将虚拟与实体活动相结合的混合型活动理念也正在萌生中。

*"Which format to choose depends on the open source project goals. Virtual events can be very valuable in reaching new geographies and transitioning to a virtual only connection is more seamless than with physical events. So in the future there will be a combination of both formats"* said Terasaki.
*“采用哪种开源活动形式取决于其目标。线上活动在拓展新的地理区域时非常有价值，与线下活动相比，过渡到完全的线下活动可以更无缝。所以，未来的开源活动会是线上线下两种形式的结合。”*，Terasaki说。

Sometimes the budget or other factors dictate the venue options.
有时预算或其他因素决定了开源活动场地的选择。

"Sometimes if budgets are looking good for the year, for this year, for example, with pandemic, probably not, everything's going to be virtual, but for previous years, we've done internal events even externally at nice little venues. It just depends on the event and it could be an internal venue as well," said Saebi.
“有时候，若一年的开源活动预算良好，不过今年由于疫情原因预算不足导致所有活动都使用线上方式，但疫情前的年份，我们甚至会把内部活动放到舒适的外部场所举办。这取决于活动的具体情况，也可能在内部场所举行”， Saebi说。

There are distinct pros and cons for each venue.
线上和线下的开源活动各自有优缺点。

For example, "virtual events open up more opportunities for people who have geographic restrictions or economic challenges to participate in physical events. We saw people from 82 countries attend a recent virtual event. This is roughly 50% more countries represented than in-person events," said Terasaki.
例如，“线上开源活动相比线下活动，为地理或经济情况限制的人们提供了更多机会。我们最近的一次线上活动，参加者来自82个国家，差不多比面对面的线下活动多了50%。”， Terasaki说。

Comcast has also seen greater attendance at virtual events.
Comcast公司的线上开源活动也有更多的参与者。

*"We did a talk on InnerSource internally and it went really well. We had, I think, 170 people show up, which is great. It's more than what we would have had in person,"* said Saebi.
*“我们举办了一次内部开源的对谈活动，非常成功。我认为有170人参加，这太好了。这比我们线下活动的参加人数更多。”*，Saebi说。

*"We're testing, experimenting, and learning. We have been breaking it up because people are getting Zoom exhaustion and conference call exhaustion and video chat exhaustion. We're trying to avoid doing the traditional eight-hour days. We're breaking it up and starting small, but so far so good."*
*”我们正在测试、试验和学习。我们对开源活动进行拆分，因为人们已经对Zoom会议、电话会议和视频聊天感到疲惫不堪。我们正努力避免进行传统的八小时全天会议，而是将其拆分成更小的部分，从简短的会议开始，目前来看效果还不错“*。

Google also found shorter formats work better in virtual events.
谷歌公司也发现线上开源活动短时长的形式效果更佳。

*"At small online developer events, past experience taught us that we lose approximately 30% of the audience every 60 min. Getting attention from the audience for a longer period of time at virtual events tends to be difficult. Shorter format is usually preferable. Look at[ Flutter Day 2020 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dEQSyfcBYs&list=PLjxrf2q8roU1rBlI9vz01K2324nzIhYgp) to see some examples of short presentations showcased during an event,"* said Cruz.
*“就小型的开发者在线开源活动来说，我们以往的经验是每过60分钟就会减少30%的参与者。在长时间的线上活动中保持参与者的关注度是一个困难的事情。可以参考[Flutter Day 2020 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dEQSyfcBYs&list=PLjxrf2q8roU1rBlI9vz01K2324nzIhYgp)开源活动上的短时长演讲案例”*， Cruz说。

Physical venues are a different arrangement entirely. There are different venues around the world for different types and sizes of meetings. But the building isn’t the only consideration.
线下实体场所是完全不同的另一种形式。全球的开源活动会议会有不同的场所类型和规模，但场所建筑本身不是唯一的考虑。

*"Reliable Wi-Fi is critical. We use our own network company now that we bring with us. But even today, most of the Wi-Fi and internet in venues is actually run by the companies that traditionally do not understand the bandwidth drain that our community will take, or the fact that they're going to be walking around with three different devices on them that are all pulling from the bandwidth at the same time,"* said Brown.
*“可靠的WiFi很重要。我们会带上和使用自己的网络服务商。但就算在今天，大多数开源活动场所的互联网WiFi的服务商，它们不了解我们开源社区对网络带宽的需求，以及社区人员的上网场景，他们会带着三个同时上网的不同设备，在会议场所到处走动。”*， Brown说。

The Wi-Fi issue is easy to miss on the planning end and hard to ignore at the event.
WiFi问题是开源活动规划时很容易被忽视，但活动举行时很难不被关注的问题。

*"The venue tells you everything is fine, and they can totally support 100 people. But you really want to be looking at 3 times that. Again, it depends on what the people are going to be doing at the event but whatever that is, there's a lot of bandwidth drain,"* Brown added.
*“会议场所人员告诉你说一起都已完备，可以承载百人规模。但你会考虑3倍的网络负载。再说明一次，这取决于活动参与人员会做什么，不管怎样都会涉及很大的网络负载”*， Brown补充到。


## Organizing the event
## 组织开源活动
 

An open source event succeeds or fails on details. Organizing every element, no matter how small, is thereby crucial, no matter what the venue is. Most successful event organizers have a plan or a checklist they follow to make sure details are not overlooked.
开源活动的成败在于细节。规划好每个活动元素，无论多细微也好，是重要的工作，和线上线下活动的场所无关。大多数成功的开源活动组织者会有一个他们遵循的活动计划或检测清单，确保不会遗漏细节事项。

Salesforce works with a template they call a program plan wherein the company identifies the overarching goals and maps out specific paths. The questions asked internally to flesh out the planning include:
Saleforce采用一种称为“项目计划”的模板来进行工作，在这个模板中，公司会确定总体目标并规划出具体路径。为了充实计划内容，内部会提出以下的问题：

* Who are we going to engage with?
* 我们要让谁参与 ？

* How is it going to be publicized?
* 如何公布开源活动？

* What is our follow-up strategy?
* 后续的跟进策略是什么？

* What is our pre-event strategy?
* 开源活动事前的策略是什么？

* What metrics do we need to use? The number of attendee or engagement levels on social media, something else?
* 我们需要哪些开源活动指标？参与者人数、参与者在社交媒体的级别、还是其他别的指标？

Below are tips for planning details you may want to add to your own event planner, or use to build one.
以下是开源活动规划细节的建议，你可以用来规划或实施你的开源活动。

**Selecting a date**
**选择开源活动日期**

Both internal and external events can easily overlap with other events which will negatively affect your event’s success. Selecting a date to enhance your odds for success is therefore of prime importance.
内外部的开源活动活动都可能与其他事件时间上冲突，会对你的活动成功产生负面影响。因此，选择一个有利于成功的日期至关重要。

*"We have an open source events calendar in our organization that our team manages and updates. All the big open source conferences are on the calendar, and others too, because you don’t want there to be a scheduling  conflict with your event, but neither do you want to burn people out by stacking conferences too close together,"* said Saebi.
*“我们内部有一个由我们团队管理和更新的开源活动日历。所有大型的开源会议都会记录在这个日历上，以及其他一些活动，这样做的目的是为了避免你的活动与其他活动在时间上冲突，同时也不想因为会议安排过于密集使参与者感到疲惫。”*， Saebi说。
 

*"I try to schedule our conferences in a slower month and in the middle of the week so people are home and free to enjoy their weekends,"* she added.
*“我尽量把会议安排在较轻松的月份和周中举办，让参与者可以在家里享受他们的周末时间”*， 她补充到。
 

Watch out for overlaps with local events unrelated to open source too, as well as for local occurrences ranging from planned strikes and protests to holiday observances.
另也需要关注开源活动和本地非开源相关活动的可能冲突，例如本地的罢工、游行和节假日庆祝等。
 

*"If you plan an event in Germany, for example, and it's a national holiday, even if all of your attendees are coming from outside of Germany and have no problem going to the event on that day, it's going to be very difficult to get the support from the local venue and vendors that you need, or all the restaurants might be closed, or taxis might not be running, etc,"* warned Brown.
*“举个例子，你规划了在德国举办一个开源活动并碰上国家节日，就算活动参与者全部来自德国以外并且在当天正常到达会场，会碰到诸多难题包括无法获得会场和活动供应商的服务、餐厅全部关门、出租车停止服务等等”*， Brown警告说。

You may think virtual events would be exempt from such concerns, but they aren’t. Holiday observances can still affect attendance and the availability of vendor support in everything from technical support to the mailing of welcome gifts or other swag.
你可能觉得线上活动会避开这些问题，但并非如此。节假日的庆祝仍然会影响活动参与情况，影响从技术支持到邮寄会议周边礼物等供应商服务。

 

**Finding and selecting speakers**
**寻找和遴选演讲者**
 

First, align speaker selection with specific goals. Closely consider your goals for the event. But you may also want to reach towards your company’s overarching goals as well as those of open source communities. This is no time to think small.
首先，将演讲者的选拔与具体目标相匹配。仔细考量开源活动的目标，但同时也应着眼于公司整体目标以及开源社区的目标。此时不宜局限于小格局的思考。
 

Consider speakers within your organization too. But finding speakers from outside of your organization doesn’t have to be any more of a daunting task than finding them internally.
也要考虑组织内部的演讲者，但从组织外部找到演讲者并不一定比从内部找到他们更加困难。
 

*"I find many of our speakers from past Open Source Summit events and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) speakers bureau, but those speakers are mostly related to CNCF projects. I think it would be a fantastic idea for everyone to contribute to building and updating a Linux Foundation speaker’s bureau,"* said Saebi, who also keeps a database of speakers that contains notable external speakers, and speakers across Comcast.
*“我发现我们的许多演讲者都是来自过去的开源峰会活动以及云原生计算基金会（CNCF）的演讲者团队，但这些演讲者大多与CNCF项目相关。我认为每个人都能去贡献并且更新一个Linux基金会的演讲者团队，这会是个很棒的主意。”*， Sarbi说，她保留了一个外部知名演讲者以及Comcast内部演讲者的数据库。

 

Other sources to look to for possible speakers for your event include paypercall.io, which Saebi finds "extremely helpful in finding speakers, especially those in open source." And, of course, social media such as LinkedIn and Twitter.
寻找你的开源活动演讲者的另一来源包括 paypercall.io 网站，Saebi评价“对寻找演讲者极其有用，尤其是在开源领域”。当然，社交媒体如LinkedIn和Twitter也一样。
 

*"I have a list that I created on Twitter. I would recommend other folks to create lists as well, but they're also more than welcome to subscribe to my list. It is called ‘open source speakers’ and it's three words,"* said Saebi. Saebi says she too looks to underrepresented groups in open source to help her find speakers. For example, she may ask women she knows in open source for recommendations on potential  women speakers.
*“我在Twitter上创建了一个列表，我建议其他人也创建类似的列表，但更期待他们订阅我的列表。这个列表叫做‘开源演讲者’，就是这三个英文单词”*， Saebi说。 Saebi还说到她会去开源领域缺少代表性的群体里寻找演讲者，例如，她会咨询开源领域的女性以获得推荐的女性演讲者。
 

 
**Developing internal speakers**
**培养内部演讲者**
 

Also consider speakers for your event based on your organization’s internal needs to develop and encourage a new and deeper bench of brand ambassadors.
也要考虑基于你所在组织的内部需求，培养和激励新的更有板凳深度的品牌宣传大使。
 

*"Internal events are a safe environment of your peers. So, we try to find people who have never given a talk before and give them this larger practice round because there's anywhere between one and three hundred people dialing into it. That gives them the confidence to go and submit to an external conference,"* said Arvin.
*“内部活动是一个由你的同事营造的安全环境。因此，我们试图找到那些从未发表过演讲的人，并给他们这个更大的实践机会，因为有一到三百人会参与这个活动。这给了他们参与外部会议的信心”*， Arvin说。
 

There are ways to add to the comfort and pacing of those new to speaking, and for more seasoned speakers too who may be feeling the wear and tear of many virtual events and far too many Zoom sessions.
有一些方法可以增加初次演讲者的舒适度和节奏掌握，同时也适用在那些经验丰富的演讲者，他们可能因参加了许多虚拟活动和过多的Zoom会议而感到疲惫不堪。
 

*"We pre-record the presentation, then we can add captions to make our events accessible. In that way, presenters can also focus on live Q&A on the day of,"* said Cruz.
*“我们提早录制好演讲，并添加字幕以让开源活动对参与者更友好。通过这种方式，演讲者也可以更聚焦在当天的现场问答”*， Cruz说。
 

Just keep in mind that you may need more than a presenter, particularly for virtual events.
需记住你需要的不止是演讲者，特别是线上开源活动。
 

*"Moderators are needed more than ever. We recruit seasoned speakers for the moderator’s role, then presenters can focus on their presentation and live Q&A,"* said Terasaki.
*“主持人协调人的需求现在更为迫切。我们聘用了资深演讲者来担任这个角色，活动演讲者就可以更聚焦在他们的演讲本身和现场问答”*， Terasaki说。
 

**Choosing platforms**
**选择线上平台**
 

If you’re planning a virtual event, you’ll want to pay close attention to your platform options because they vary significantly in many important ways.
如果你在规划线上开源活动，你将要关注你的线上平台的功能选项，因为它们有很多重要的差异。
 

*"We did a virtual event platform comparison of 65 different platforms and a lot of these were simply about content delivery. And obviously, for Linux Foundation events, we're looking for something different than that,"* said Brown.
*“”我们比对了65个不同的线上活动平台，很多只是简单的内容发送。显然对Linux基金会来说，我们需要寻找另一种平台*， Brown说。
 

The results of the[ Linux Foundation’s platform comparisons](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jGd0geh72Lxr0o3zV044K5yhXc6Q8tp4p8fhnnXJsqo/edit#slide=id.p3) are now freely available. You’ll want to check back periodically because this is a fluid document, Brown says. But here are samples of the results as of September 2020:
Linux基金会线上平台比对的结果 [ Linux Foundation’s platform comparisons](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jGd0geh72Lxr0o3zV044K5yhXc6Q8tp4p8fhnnXJsqo/edit#slide=id.p3) ，现在可以免费查看，你需要定期查看这个结果因为这是个动态文档，Brown说。这里是截至2020年9月的一些结果：

![platform comparison](/img/guides/organizing-and-managing-open-source-events1.jpg)

![speciality platfomr comparison](/img/guides/organizing-and-managing-open-source-events2.jpg)

 

The Linux Foundation is also journaling their organizers’ experience with each platform after an event to give members a more detailed accounting of successes and failures. You can find that in[ blog posts](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/2020/06/03/success-with-qiqochat/) on the events landing page.
Linux基金会也记录了开源活动组织者们使用线上平台后的成功失败经验，你可以在这个开源活动页面查看 [ blog posts](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/2020/06/03/success-with-qiqochat/)
 

Google looks for a specific set of features and functionalities, as well.
谷歌在寻找专门的线上平台特性和功能。


*"We value compliance, safety, diversity, Inclusion, and accessibility. We try to pay extra attention to that and adjust the environment for online events. Do we have captions? Does the recording platform have a function for speakers to change font size for speaker notes?, etc,"* said Terasaki.
*“我们重视合规、安全、多元化、包容性、以及易用性。我们在开源线上活动中致力于这些目标并调整活动环境。我们有演讲字幕吗？录制平台能让演讲者调整脚注字体吗？如此等等”*， Terasaki说。
 

*"Choosing the right event platform is the key for success. A great user interface with multiple engagement tools and functions that attendees are looking for at virtual events is imperative,"* Terasaki added.
*“选择正确的平台是成功的关键。优秀的用户界面、多种接入工具以及参与者需要的功能，是线上开源活动的关键”*， Terasaki补充到。

 

Events held in physical venues also require careful attention to apps and networking platforms. Some of the options are flexible enough to successfully pull off cross-over duties between virtual and physical, which may make them useful going forward with blended venues.
线下活动同样需要关注app和社交平台。有些可选产品提供足够的灵活性，让线上线下的交叉活动都能成功开展，让产品在后续的混合场景下更为有用。
 

*"MeetingPlay started as a networking app. They have done a very good job of pivoting to be a virtual event platform. That's one that we've been really happy with,"* says Brown.
*“MeetingPlay最早是一个社交app，他们成功地转型为线上活动平台，这是我们非常满意的产品”*， Brown说。
 

*"For physical events, we do have some options we like for networking and to facilitate people meeting each other at events. One that we use is an app called Brella, which is really a networking app, but it's not a full-blown event app that we would keep a schedule on and do push notifications. It's really just for networking and it has an event matchmaking feature on it,"* Brown explained.
*“对于实体活动，我们确实有一些喜欢的产品选项，为参与者提供现场的认识聚会能力。我们使用的一个app叫Brella，它实质上是一款社交应用而不是一个功能全面的活动管理应用，我们不会在上面安排日程或推送通知。Brella主要用于社交并提供一个活动现场人员匹配的功能，”*， Brown解释到。
 

Make sure your expectations and goals are aligned when deciding to use these types of apps.
在决策使用这些app时需要确保匹配你的期望和目标。
 

*"For example, in an Open Source Summit, I'd say probably only 15% or 20% of people actually like using Brella or any other app, but the people who are using it, get huge value out of it,"* says Brown.
*“例如在一个开源峰会中，我估计只有15%或20%的人真正会用 Brella或其他app，但使用的人会充分利用其功能”*， Brown说。


**Soliciting volunteers**
**招募志愿者**

Start by identifying the tasks, dates and times you need volunteers to help out.
首先，确定你需要志愿者帮忙的任务、日期和时间
 

*"You can't do this by yourself, you have to have volunteers to help with this initiative. I look for ‘day of’ volunteers as well as folks who want to help with some of the organizing, but mostly ‘day of’ is the most important,"* said Saebi.
*“你不能一个人完成任务，你必须有志愿者来帮助这个活动。我寻找‘活动当天’的志愿者以及有意愿提供一些组织工作帮助的人，但最重要的主要是‘活动当天’的志愿者。”*， Saebi说。
 

*"A few things to check that your ‘day of’ volunteers can help you with is, will there be a check-in station for when your conference attendees arrive? And there should be,"* Saebi added.
*“几个可以为你确认‘活动当天’志愿者能帮助你的事情，会场是否有参与者到达时的登记站，这个应该有”*， Saebi补充到。
 

Soliciting volunteers for a physical or a virtual event can be challenging. But there are several ways one can be successful in the endeavor. Take for example, how Salesforce manages and encourages volunteerism.
为线下和线上开源活动招募志愿者会有一定挑战，这个努力过程中有几种成功的方法，Saleforce公司管理和激励志愿者的实践可以作为案例。
 

Volunteer Time Off is a formal program at Salesforce. It begins on the first day of employment when, as part of their on-boarding, new employees often go to volunteer somewhere with their on-boarding class. Volunteering is thus established early on as both the spirit of the company culture and as an ongoing job expectation.
志愿者假期是Saleforce公司的正式制度。这从员工的第一天上班就开始了，作为入职的一部分，新员工通常会和他们的入职班级一起去某个地方做志愿者工作。因此，从一开始，志愿服务就被确立为公司文化的精神和持续的工作期望。
 

*"Volunteering is really a core part of our business and that's well enshrined in company programs and well supported. So, we thought let's tap into that to help people make those first contributors to Open Source. To help them get over that hump of the initial barrier of having never contributed to Open Source before in such a way that we are both raising awareness of our reliance on Open Source and on Open Source’s reliance on volunteers,"* said Simmons.
*“志愿服务真的是我们业务的核心部分，这在公司的制度中得到了很好的体现和支持。所以，我们想，让我们利用这一点来帮助人们成为开源项目的第一批贡献者。帮助他们克服从未为开源项目做过贡献的初期障碍，同时我们也在提高对我们依赖开源项目，以及开源项目依赖志愿者的意识。”*， Simmons说。
 

It turns out that Volunteer Time Off is an excellent source for volunteers for open source events as well.
志愿者假期的结果证明了它也是开源活动志愿者的一个最佳来源。
 

*"So much of this is trial and error. Like all Open Source program offices are trying to figure this out. We also try to tie volunteer hours to exact metrics to see if the event or topic is something that is of interest to people,"* said Arvin.
*“开源活动大部分都是一个试错过程。所有的OSPO开源项目办公室都在试图解决这个问题。我们也尝试将志愿者的工作时间与明确的指标相关联，以判断开源活动或主题是否引起人们的兴趣"。”*， Arvin说。
 

She cited an example of how volunteer metrics translate to a broader interest in an open source event. For example, if the Salesforce OSPO aims for 40 people to volunteer at an event and end ups getting 50, then the company has a strong indication that people are interested in the topic or event. But if just 15 volunteers responded instead, then that is a strong indication that the event isn’t a good draw or that the marketing may be off target.
她举了一个例子，说明如何将志愿者的数据转化为对开源活动的更广泛的兴趣。例如，如果Salesforce OSPO目标是在一个活动中招募40位志愿服务，结果50人报名，那么公司就能收到人们对这个主题或活动感兴趣的强烈信号。但若只有15名志愿者报名，那么也是个强烈信号，说明该活动可能并不吸引人，或者活动宣传可能偏离了目标。


*"Having those metrics also gives us a baseline of what our employees are interested in doing. And it tells us what is working in spreading the word of Open Source,"* Arvin said.
*“这些指标是我们公司员工其工作兴趣的基线，它告诉我们开源领域的传播中什么是有效的”*， Arvin说。

**Gifts, swag and acknowledgments**
**礼物、周边和致谢**


Gifts, swag, and acknowledgments remain important elements in event planning. Generally, they are used to reward, thank, and incentivize speakers, volunteers, attendees, sponsors, and communities.
礼物、周边和致谢仍然是开源活动规划的重要元素。它们通常用于回馈、感谢和激励演讲者、志愿者、参与者、赞助商和社区。
 

It was wise to order these items early as traditionally it takes longer than you’d think to have the items made and delivered on time. Early orders also give you a chance to have changes made if something is wrong with the order or a vendor fails to follow through. But given recent cutbacks in the U.S. Postal Service and the extraordinary workloads other carriers are dealing with during a pandemic, it’s wise to order even earlier than normal.
提前订购这些物品是明智的，因为通常制作和准时交付这些物品需要的时间比你想象的要长。提前订购也让你有机会在订单出错或供应商未能完成订单时进行修改。但是，考虑到美国邮政服务近期的削减，以及其他承运人在疫情期间面临的巨大工作负荷，比正常情况更早的预订是明智之举。
 

And, yes, you can give gifts, swag, and acknowledgements in virtual events too. Some of these can even be digital such as a month of a TV or video streaming service, or credits on riding services like Uber or Lyft. Credits on food services such as Instacart or UberEATS is another idea. Of course, many event organizers also send traditional gifts, particularly to speakers and volunteers.  Your budget will affect your gift and swag choices too.
当然，你也可以在线上活动中送出礼物、周边和致谢。其中一些甚至可以是数字化的，例如一个月的电视或视频流媒体服务，或者Uber或Lyft之类的网约车服务积分。Instacart或UberEATS之类的食品服务的积分也是一个选择。当然，许多活动组织者也会发送传统的礼品，特别是给发言者和志愿者。你的预算也会影响你的礼品和周边的选择。
 

Just be careful to think your choices through to avoid pitfalls. For example, don’t give credits to digital services unless you’re sure those services are available locally for speakers, volunteers, or other giftees. There are also other things to consider, depending on location and other factors.
请谨慎地思考你的选择，以避免陷阱。例如，除非你确定演讲者、志愿者或其他接受礼物的人的所在地可以使用数字服务礼物，否则不要赠送这些数字服务的积分。还有其他事情需要考虑，具体取决于地理位置和其他因素。
 

"One time, I got the speakers really nice gift baskets which included mugs and fruit and all kinds of nice goodies. But the speakers couldn’t fit those in their carry-ons. I felt so bad. So, if you're buying a gift for people who are traveling, make sure that it's something they can travel with," said Saebi.
“有一次，我为演讲者准备了一个非常好的礼品包，里面有马克杯、水果和很不错的美食。但演讲者没法把礼品包塞进旅行行李。我感到非常遗憾。所以，如果你要为旅行的人们准备礼物，要确保这些礼物是可以在旅途中携带。”， Saebi说。
 

Think back to swag and gifts you’ve received or seen at other conferences. That’s likely to help you come up with good ideas for yours.
回想一下你曾经收到过或见过的会议周边和礼物，这会帮助你想出好主意。
 

For example, Saebi says that one of the best gifts she received at a conference, she’s still using today. *"I've been using it through the quarantine as well, it was from the Linux Foundation for the Open Source Summit, North America. I want to say either, I think Los Angeles maybe, or maybe Vancouver, but it's a cutting board that looks like a surfboard. It's amazing. So yeah, I think personalized gifts like that are really nice,"* she said.
例如，Saebi说她收到过的最好礼物，直到现在还在使用。*“我在疫情期间都在使用它，它是来自Linux基金会北美开源峰会的礼物，我记得可能在洛杉矶或温哥华，它是一个像冲浪板的砧板。非常棒。所以，我觉得个性化的礼物是很不错的主意。”*，她说。
 

Before shopping for gifts, make sure to make a list of everyone who should receive something, and then buy a few extras for volunteers who join last minute or people you may have initially overlooked, like moderators or an emcee.
采购礼物之前，需要准备一个所有接受礼物的人员的名单，然后再增补一些给坚持到最后的志愿者，或你可能开始时忘记的人们，例如主持人或协调人等。
 

Recognitions can take the form of gifts or public shoutouts. Often, organizers choose to do both.
开源活动的表彰可以采用礼物或公众宣传的形式，组织者通常会两个都使用。
 

*"I usually do include recognitions in the beginning and at the end of the event. But those should be personalized too. For example, some people are shy and they don't like public attention. So I don't say, "Hey, stand up, wave your hands." Some of them would say they hate that experience. And so, I think just calling their name out is good enough,"* said Saebi.  
*“我通常会在活动的开始和结束时进行表彰。但这些表彰也应该是个性化的。例如，有些人很害羞，他们不喜欢公众场合被关注。所以我不会说，'嘿，站起来，挥挥你的手。'有些人会说他们讨厌那样的经历。所以，我认为只是叫出他们的名字就足够好了。”*， Saebi说。
 

Often volunteer are given matching tee- shirts with the event logo on them if it's a big external event. Stickers, even general open source stickers, are a big hit with volunteers and attendees. Both stickers and tee shirts are often on a table for the taking by attendees and volunteers, so you may want to add something a little extra just for volunteers.
通常，如果是大型的外部活动，志愿者会被给予印有活动logo的配套T恤。贴纸，即使是通用的开源贴纸，都非常受志愿者和与会者的欢迎。贴纸和T恤往往会摆放在桌子上，让与会者和志愿者自由取用，所以你可能会希望为志愿者额外添加一些礼物。
 

And, it’s perfectly ok to regift swag too. After all, spreading the word of other conferences, communities and projects is entirely the point of stickers and swag, so feel free to spread it around.
另外，再次使用周边礼物是非常可行的。贴纸和周边礼物的目的就是为了推广其他开源会议、社区和项目。所以，请自由分发它们。
 

*"I always take other swag as well from other open source conferences, especially for our internal events because not everybody has the opportunity to go to let's say Open Source Summit, North America. So in that case, Nithya, myself, and members of our team, we always have extra swag and extra stickers to offer later,"* said Shilla Saebi.
*“我总是从其他开源会议那里获取一些周边礼物，特别是对于我们的内部活动，因为并不是每个人都有机会去参加例如北美开源峰会这样的活动。所以在这种情况下，Nithya，我以及我们团队的成员总是有额外的周边礼物和贴纸可以后续提供。”*， Shilla Saebi说。

**Registration**
**活动注册**

Registration fees continue to be a vexing issue.
活动注册费始终是一个麻烦的问题。

*"Most of our events have been free. We may have done one where it was external facing and we charged a small fee and we noticed that it was harder to get people to register. But charging a fee helps reduce no shows so it’s a difficult decision,"* said Saebi.
*“我们的大多数活动都是免费的。我们可能做过一次面向外部的活动，我们收取了少量费用，我们注意到这个更难让人们注册。但是收费有助于减少未出席的情况，所以这是一个困难的决定。”*， Saebi说。

Comparing your event with similar events is often a good way to measure market expectation and response.
把你的开源活动与类似的活动做比对，这常常是一个度量市场期望和市场反应的好方法。

*"We very much look at what everyone else is charging. Like most folks who are planning open-source events, we’re trying to cover the cost of the event rather than make money on it,"* said Brown.
*“我们非常关注其他人的收费情况。和大多数开会活动规划者一样，我们只是想收回活动成本而不是从中获利”*， Brown说。

While traditional tech events charge up to $4,000 or even more for people to attend an event, open source events rarely command similarly high fees.
虽然传统的技术活动会向参会者收取多达4000美元的会费，开源活动极少会收取高额费用。

*"In the US, companies understand the value of a developer going to a conference, so they often fund several conferences throughout the year. But there are still a lot of countries where that's not true and developers have to foot the bill on their own,"* said Brown.
*“”在美国，企业认可开发者参加会议的价值，企业会资助一年内几个会议的费用。但始终有很多国家不是如此，开发者需要自行支付会议费用。*， Brown说。

*"China and Japan are both great examples where we simply can't charge the same registration fees there. We have to be very careful where we hold events because developers do not get travel budgets to go to events. They barely get any money to go to attend an event or a registration fee. You really have to think about what that local market will actually bear too,"* said Brown.
*“中国和日本都是很好的例子，我们无法在那里收取相同的注册费。我们必须非常小心地选择举办活动的地方，因为开发者并没有去参加活动的旅行预算。他们几乎没有任何钱去参加一个开源活动或支付注册费。你真的必须考虑到当地市场究竟能承受多少。”*， Brown说。

Economic cycles also affect what can be charged for registration and sponsorships. There are other considerations to how to handle registrations as well, such as GDPR and privacy policies. Compliance with the various privacy regulations must be maintained in the registration process and everything that occurs afterward.
经济周期也影响了注册和赞助所能收取的费用。关于如何处理注册，还有其他的考虑因素，比如GDPR和隐私政策。在注册过程和后续发生的所有事情中，都必须遵守各种隐私规定。

*"You really want to be careful of that in your registration. Let people know you're going to be sharing their contact information, because you're legally obligated to do so. It is important to get the right verbiage in there, especially if you're going to have sponsors that you're giving any information to,"* said Brown.
*“在你的注册流程中，你真的要小心这一点。让人们知道你将分享他们的联系信息，因为你有法律义务这样做。将正确的服务协议写入其中是非常重要的，尤其是当你有赞助商并会向它们提供任何信息。”*， Brown说。

Be sure to print any materials you’ll need from marketing and directional signage to banners and attendee handouts a month or more ahead of the event. Typically, attendee materials, including event stickers, are distributed at registration.
确保在活动开始前一个月或更早就打印出你需要的任何材料，从营销、会场方向指引、会场横幅到参与者手册。通常，包括活动贴纸在内的参与者材料，会在注册时发放。

*"We put stickers on all the tables that people are sitting at, stickers for the actual event,"* said Saebi. *“Make sure to get the pronouns of your speakers. And ideally you should perhaps even ask for pronouns when people are checking in to the conference. If you have pronoun stickers like she, her, they, them, that'll be nice to add on the sticker table as well.”*
*"我们在所有人们坐的桌子上贴上了贴纸，这些贴纸是为实际活动制作的，"Saebi说。"确保获取你的演讲者的称谓词。理想情况下，你甚至应该在人们签到参加会议时询问称谓词。如果你有她，她，他们，他们这样的代词贴纸，那么在贴纸桌上添加这些会很好。"*

Registration desks also have swag readily available as well as name tags, lanyards and other event items. These can also be used in virtual events in various ways from standard pics or avatars, to a variety of gamification options.
登记台上还准备好了周边礼品，以及姓名卡片、挂绳和其他活动物品。类似这样的各种方式也可以使用在线上活动，从标准照片或虚拟头像，到各种游戏化选项。

**Hashtags**
**社交话题标签**

Social media is as strong as ever in promoting and recording events. A well-chosen hashtag is therefore essential to your efforts.
社交媒体一直以来是推广记录开源活动的强有力手段。因此一个精心选取的社交话题标签对你的工作很重要。
 

Typically, hashtags are set up prior to the event and generally plastered everywhere during the event.
典型情况下，社交话题标签要早于开源活动之前就设计好，并在活动期间尽量到处张贴展示。
 

*"The hashtag is really helpful because if I have a unique hashtag on Twitter for a certain event, I can actually go back and look at all the tweets from three years ago or two years ago from that event. And you can keep that same hashtag going for future events, or however you want to do it. But it's nice and useful thing to have,"* said Saebi.
*“社交话题标签真的很有帮助，因为如果我在Twitter上为某个特定的活动设定了一个独一无二的话题标签，我实际上可以回去查看该活动三年前或两年前的所有推文。你也可以将同一个话题标签用于未来的活动，或者按你想要的任何方式去使用。拥有社交话题标签是很好也是有用的。”*， Saebi说。
 

*"And it gives people a platform or idea or an area to go. I know a lot of people congregate on Twitter. I also make sure to tell the speakers to put their Twitter handles on their slides. They don't have to, it's just a suggestion in case people want to reach out to them,"* Saebi added.
*“社交媒体给了人们一个可以使用的平台、想法和交流的地方。我知道很多人会聚在Twitter上。我也会确保告诉演讲者将他们的Twitter账号放在他们的幻灯片上。他们不必一定要这样做，只是一个建议，以便人们想要联系他们”*， Saebi补充到。

**Side events and break planning**
**附加活动和休息间歇规划**

It’s general knowledge that neither speakers nor attendees are keen on early morning events and talks. What may not be so generally known is that fact holds true for virtual events as well. People may be attending from home, but their early mornings tend to be a bit frantic, especially if there are kids to get to school and pets to walk.
通常而言，演讲者和参与者都不怎么喜欢早晨的活动和讲座。可能并不是每个人都知道，这同样适用于线上活动。人们可能是在家里参加活动，但他们的早晨往往会有些紧张，特别是如果有需要送去学校的孩子或需要遛的宠物。

*"Now I start at 9:30 AM or 10:00 AM, and then we leave 30 minutes or an hour in the morning for people to congregate and eat breakfast. I think 9:00 AM start time may work as well. But I usually do 9:30 or 10. Considering that we do after events too at physical events, it can be really exhausting on people to be on for 12 or 14 hours that day,"* said Saebi.
*“我现在通常会在9:30或10:00开始开源活动，在早晨留下30分钟或一个小时让人们聚集并吃早餐。我想9:00的开始时间可能也是可以的。但是我通常是9:30或者10点开始。考虑到我们在线下实体活动结束后还有会后活动，让人们在那一天工作12或14小时会非常疲惫。”*， Saebi说。

Don’t drag the day on too long for virtual events either.
不要把线上活动的时长也拉得太长。

*"It's one thing to get someone to attend a virtual event, but what's your dwell time going to be? How long is someone going to stick around? That's the big question that we are trying to figure out because what that looks like in this first round of virtual events that we do is going to help us decide what we do with the ones after that. But there are related questions too such as is a full day just too long and we need to break these up into couple hour increments a day and do them for more days or do something entirely different,"* said Brown.
*“吸引人们参加线上活动是一回事，但是他们会待多久呢？他会坚持多久？这是我们正在努力弄清楚的一个重大问题，因为我们在首轮线上活动中的这种情况，将帮助我们决定如何规划之后的活动。但是还有一些相关的问题，比如一整天是否太长，我们是否需要将这些活动分拆为每天几个小时的增量方式，并且持续更多的天数，或者完全另辟蹊径”*， Brown说。

The length of events matters significantly. Based on surveys and feedback, Comcast found that neither speakers or attendees like one hour talks.
开源活动的时间长度非常重要。基于调查和反馈，Comcast公司发现演讲者和参与者都不喜欢一小时以上的对话。

*"Those are too long. I try to do shorter talks. If it's a keynote, we can do 30 minutes, maybe 35 minutes max. But typically, the talks are 25 to 30 minutes, keep them short and sweet,"* said Saebi.
*“那些议程太长了。我尽量安排较短的演讲。如果是主题演讲，我们会安排30分钟或最长35分钟。但典型的演讲是25-30分钟，让它们保持简短和愉悦。”*， Saebi说。

Similarly, Comcast found that talks need to be short in virtual events as well.
Comcast公司也同样发现在线活动的演讲也应该保持简短。

*"People are getting Zoom exhaustion and conference call exhaustion and video chat exhaustion. We're trying to avoid doing eight-hour days. We're breaking up talks into much smaller sessions over more days but shorter hours per day,"* said Saebi.
*“人们对Zoom会议、电话会议、视频对话感到疲惫不堪。我们尽量避免一天8小时的活动时长，我们会把演讲拆分为更短小的多个环节，采用多天但每天时长更小的安排”*， Saebi说。

It’s a common problem for all event organizers on the moment, but it probably bodes well for events post-pandemic.
这对当下所有的活动组织者都是一个常见问题，但疫情之后应该会有好的未来前景。

 "There's a huge challenge because one, people are stuck at home. You could argue that they will have no problem sitting in front of their computer all day at a conference. But the flip side of that is people are tired of being stuck at home. As things open up, people just want to get out of the house and experience some semblance of normal life again," said Brown.
 “这是一个巨大的挑战，首先，人们被困在家里。你可以说他们在计算机前参加全天的会议没有问题。但是，另一方面，人们已经厌倦了待在家里。随着疫情逐步开放，人们只想出门，再次体验一些正常生活的样子。”， Brown说。

Socializing and networking have always been big draws at conferences. That’s why breaks should remain frequent and certainly placed between every talk. In physical events this allows for the always popular and beneficial hallway track. Most organizers are still struggling to create a similar experience in virtual events. However, experiments are currently underway.
社交和联络在会议中始终是一大亮点。这就是为什么应该频繁地休息，并确保在每一场演讲对谈之间都有休息。在线下实体活动中，这为广受欢迎且有益的走廊交谈提供了可能。大多数线上虚拟活动组织者仍在努力创造类似体验。然而目前尚在实验中。

*"I recently went to the InnerSource Commons event where they had virtual breakout rooms. You could actually be moved into another Zoom room with other folks and just kind of relax and have a more chill conversation and then go back to the main conference when you want. I thought that was really good,"* said Saebi.
*“我最近参加了InnerSource Commons活动，他们设有虚拟小组讨论室。你实际上可以和其他人一起转到另一个Zoom房间，放松下来，进行更轻松的交谈，然后在你想要的时候返回主会议。我认为那真的很好，”*， Saebi说。

Evening events are common at physical venues. These can last from 30 minutes to a couple hours and can be anything from mixers to dinners, but they always have a social and networking vibe. Distributing virtual or physical drink tickets, usually limited at two per person, controls the cost and limits excessive drinking as it reinforces the code of conduct. Tickets are good for alcoholic drinks but other drinks as well such as water, coffees, juices, and sodas.
线下实体场所通常会有晚间活动。这些活动可以持续从30分钟到几个小时，可以是任何形式，比如社交聚会或晚宴，但它们总是带有社交和联络的氛围。分发虚拟或实体的饮品票，通常每人限制两张，既可以控制成本又可以限制过度饮酒，保证行为规范。饮品票不仅可以换取酒精饮料，还可以换取其他饮料，如水、咖啡、果汁和苏打水。

Other questions organizers will need to answer in advance include whether the event should be private and if so does it need a passcode. Do you need to send invitations or will an announcement on Slack or social media work as well or better?
组织者需要提前回答的其他问题，包括活动是否应该是私密的，如果是的话是否需要密码。你需要发送邀请吗，在Slack或社交媒体上的通知是否同样或更好地起作用？

**Code of Conduct**
**行为准则**

The Code of conduct remains critically important to any event, physical or virtual.
行为准则是任何活动的关键，无分线下和线上。
 

*"I'm proud to say we're one of the first open-source organizations and events that had one at their events," says Brown. She says the Linux Foundation’s code of conduct is freely available in the creative commons license and “anyone may pull from it.”*  
*"我很自豪地说，我们是最早在活动中定义行为准则的开源组织之一，" Brown说，Linux基金会的行为准则通过CC创意共享许可协议中自由获取，“任何人都可以拉取使用”*
 

However, just having a code of conduct alone is not enough. It is important to distribute your code of conduct before and during events and regularly point people to it.
然而，仅仅有行为准则还不足够。在开源活动之前和活动期间分发活动准则，并定期引导人员，这是非常重要的。
 

*"We put it out at registration on a banner, it's very easy to find on our website. It goes out on our email communications. We mention on the keynote stage. You also need to make sure that whoever is running your conference knows how to address any code of conduct issues that come up,"* said Brown.
*“我们在活动注册时把行为准则放在了横幅上，它在我们的网站上非常容易找到。在我们的电子邮件沟通中被发出。我们在主题演讲中提及它。你还需要确保会议负责人知道如何处理任何行为准则问题，”*， Brown说。
 

Comcast uses its own existing code of conduct for internal events. And uses a template to compose one for external events. Other organizations do similarly.
Comcast公司在内部活动中使用已有的行为准则，在外部活动则使用一个行为准则的编排模板。其他公司也类似。

**Food and drinks planning**
**食物和饮品规划**


Food and drinks are part of the necessary planning in physical events. If the event is internal and held on company grounds, food and drink options are often limited to what the company’s selected caterer offers. However, there are a few planning tricks that can make that easier to arrange.
食物和饮品是线下实体活动必要的规划之一。如果活动是内部的，并且在公司的场地内进行，食物和饮料的选择通常仅限于公司选择的餐饮服务商提供的。然而，有一些规划技巧可以使这变得更容易安排。
 

*"I place an order through the catering company for the maximum for our internal venue, which is 300 people. And then I ask how late I can adjust the order. Typically caterers will give you two weeks which is great because by then you’ll have a much better idea how many people are expected to attend that event,"* said Saebi.
*“我通过餐饮公司预订我们内部场地最高人数的食物，也就是300人。然后我询问我能多晚调整订单。一般情况下，餐饮公司会给你两周的时间，这很好，因为到那时你会对预计有多少人参加那个活动有更好的了解”*， Saebi说。
 

*"I learned that little trick from wedding planning, because that's how it was for our wedding. So I started asking the same thing for conferences and discovered that I don't have to have the exact number today, as long as they give me the date of when they need it by,"* Saebi added.
*“我从婚礼策划中学到了这个小窍门，因为我们的婚礼就是这样的。所以我开始在组织会议时问同样的问题，然后我发现我并不需要在今天就给出确切的人数，只要他们告诉我需要确切人数的日期就可以了。”*， Saebi补充到。
 

Besides a headcount, you’ll need to consider varying dietary needs such as diabetic, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, kosher, and keto diets. Coffee, tea, diet drinks, sodas, and water should be plentiful and available all day.
除了要统计人头外，你还需要考虑各种不同的饮食需求，比如糖尿病饮食、无麸质食品、纯素食、素食、犹太食品和生酮饮食。咖啡、茶、低热量饮料、碳酸饮料和水应该充足，并且全天都可以提供。
 

This is also an area where you may need a volunteer to lend a hand.
这也是你需要志愿者支持的地方。
 

*"Assign one person to be the contact for the caterer. All they have to do is answer their phone when the caterer calls and let them in the venue. Everything else, including the bill, is taken care of in advance, so the only additional thing the volunteer might need to do is maybe guide the caterers to where they need to go,"* said Saebi.
*“指定一人作为餐饮服务商的联系人。他们要做的就是在餐饮服务商打电话时接听，并让他们进入场地。其他所有事项，包括账单，都会提前处理好，所以志愿者可能需要做的唯一额外事情，就是可能需要引导餐饮服务商到他们需要去的地方，”*， Saebi说。
 

Once the menu is decided, make it known to attendees when and where the food is, and what’s on the various available menus. If you’re not serving lunch or dinner, offer a list of nearby restaurants and cafes so attendees can easily see their options.
一旦菜单确定下来，就要让与会者知道餐厅的开放时间和地点，以及各种可选菜单上有什么。如果你没有提供午餐或晚餐，可以提供附近餐厅和咖啡店的列表，这样与会者就可以轻松看到他们的可选项。
 

Food and drinks for evening events must also be based on a range of dietary restrictions. Mixers can rely on light appetizers only while dinners may contain several courses and menu options. Dining and drinking venues within walking distance of the event venue or hotels generally work best as it simplifies transportation issues.  
晚间活动的食物和饮料也必须基于各种饮食限制。酒会可以仅以轻食为主，晚餐则可能包含多个菜式和菜单选项。餐饮场与活动场地或酒店在步行距离之内通常效果最好，这样可以简化交通问题。
 

However, the pandemic may have permanently changed how food is served in future physical events, at least during the event itself.
然而，疫情可能永久改变未来线下实体活动的餐食服务，至少在活动期间。
 

*"Communal food may shift to grab-and-go, pre-packed boxes moving forward instead of buffets,"* said Cruz.
*“可共享的食物，可能转向即取即走的形式、预先包装好的餐盒取代以往的自助餐。”*， Cruz说。
 

In virtual events, food and drink are choices made by the individual attendee. The alternative is to offer digital credits with food delivery apps so attendees can have a meal or respite together in a casual Zoom or other platform networking room.
线上虚拟活动中，餐饮是每位与会者自行完成。可选的替代方案是提供食品配送app的数字积分，这样参与者可以在轻松的Zoom会议或其他平台的社交空间里一起用餐或休息

**Followups**
**活动后续跟进**

While patterns were set, trends made, and playbooks refined before the pandemic, everything was upended after the pandemic hit and will likely change again once the pandemic subsides. This makes followup evaluations all the more crucial in adapting and improving the function, performance, and attendance in future events.
虽然在疫情之前已经设定了开源活动模式，形成了趋势，优化了活动脚本，但在疫情爆发之后所有这些都被打乱了，在疫情消退后可能还会再次改变。这使得后续的评估在适应和改进未来活动的能力、表现和参与度等方面变得至关重要。
 

Post-event surveys are a steadfast measure on everything from speaker performance to event relevance and the general enjoyment factor. Typically, the results are used by organizers for future event planning, but not always. Positive remarks are often shared with the speakers who earned them. And positive comments about the event are often used in marketing materials for future versions of the same event.
活动结束后的调查是一个可靠的衡量标准，涵盖从演讲者的表现到活动的相关性，以及常用的愉悦度指标。通常，调查结果会被组织者用于未来的活动策划，但也不尽然如此。积极的评价往往会反馈给赢得这些评价的演讲者。而关于活动的正面评论也常被用于未来同类活动的营销宣传材料中。
 

Further, snippets or full videos of speakers are sometimes shared with speakers for inclusion in their own work portfolios, on YouTube, and to market future events.
此外，活动演讲的片段或完整视频，有时会分享给演讲者用于纳入他们自己的作品集，放到YouTube，以及为后续活动做营销推广。
 

Comcast, like many companies, has a tight policy around making and sharing videos of speakers at events. Speaker consent is one of the top requirements. Costs are another determining factor. Even so, videos are only shared internally with "strict guard rails around anything requiring legal compliance."
Comcast公司和许多公司一样，有严谨的政策来制作和分享演讲者的会议演讲视频。演讲者的同意是首要前提之一，成本是另一个决策因素。即便如此，这些视频在“需要法律规管的内容必须严格管控”场景下只能内部使用。
 

*"If the venue has AV options and if they are not that expensive, we'll ask them to record it and then we can post it on our open source program office website. We’ve also recorded some ourselves, taken pictures ourselves, and hired a photographer sometimes as well,"* said Saebi.
*“如果活动场地有音视频录制设备，而且价格不是那么高，我们会要求他们录制下来，然后我们可以在我们的开源项目办公室网站上发布。我们也会自己录制一些，自己拍摄图片，有时也会雇佣摄影师”*， Saebi说。
 

Following up to thank the volunteers is also essential. Consider sending thank you cards and notes, or even small gifts. Adding the results of their efforts- such as growth in attendance or accolades from attendees -- to the thank you notes is also a good touch.
答谢志愿者也是活动后续跟进的重要环节。可以考虑发出致谢卡片和感谢信，甚至小礼物。在感谢信中加入志愿者的工作成果也是一个很好的做法，例如活动参与者数量、参与者的赞誉等。
 

Followup activities can also be used to extend the experience between events and encourage further engagement.
活动后续跟进工作也能用在多个活动之间的经验分享，鼓励更多参与。
 

*"We do try to make sure that people leave with something tangible to do. For example, we may make some suggestions on how attendees can find a project to work on after the event, such as after Tech Talks, the Open Source Tech Talks and the volunteer events,"* said Simmons.  *“We also suggest places to go to get support. Ultimately, we want to make sure they feel strong and empowered coming out of those events.”*
*“我们在努力确保让人们参加完会议有具体的事项可以做，例如，我们建议参与者可以在会后找一个可投入工作的项目，包括会后的技术讲座、开源技术讲座、志愿者活动等”*， Simmons说，*“我们也推荐一些可提供支持的地点。总而言之，我们希望参与者在参加完会议感觉到力量和被赋能。”*

There are also followup activities that can help your brand benefit from its efforts in providing useful events.
有些跟进工作可以为你的品牌带来收益，它们可以提供后续的有价值活动。

*"We're very careful about not spamming people but we do send one email that offers more information on different points of interest with links to our Open Source page, our blog, highlights from the booth, and information about any demos that we shared for any of the external events,"* said Arvin.
*“我们非常注意不滥发邮件给人们，但我们确实会发送一封电子邮件，提供覆盖不同兴趣点的更多信息，包含我们的开源页面、博客、展台亮点，以及我们在外部活动中分享的演示信息等链接。”*， Arvin说。
 

 

## Marketing an open source event
## 开源活动营销宣传
 

Marketing is the key to success for any event, regardless of venue. Marketing tactics will vary according to size and type of event and the goals the organizers intend to achieve.
营销宣传是所有开源活动的关键，无分活动场所。其策略会根据活动规模、组织者希望达成的目标而变化。
 

However, below are some marketing tips, strategies, and tactics that tend to work out well for many events.
但是，如下的营销推广指引、战略和技巧可适用于许多活动并行之有效。
 

**1) Leverage social media:** Publicize events on social media channels because messages there can be shared more broadly than to the number of people you have on a mailing list. Consider buying ads on Google, Facebook, and others too.
**1） 利用好社交媒体：** 把开源活动公布在社交媒体，因为相比你的邮件列表可以被更广泛地分享传播。也可以考虑购买谷歌、Facebook等广告。
 

**2) Email campaigns work well:** Mailing lists fuel email campaigns. When cultivated and maintained carefully mailing lists can extend the reach beyond the lists of attendees from past events. Typically, the email schedule for a n email campaign is:
**2）邮件宣传行之有效** 邮件列表为活动宣传提供火力。精心培育和维护的邮件列表可以延伸到比以往活动的参与者更远。通常来说，邮件营销的执行计划是：
 

a.     Announce an upcoming event
a.     发布一个即将开始的活动

b.     Push for submissions
b.     推动提交活动注册

c.      Reminder for the approaching deadline for submissions
c.      提醒活动注册的截止日

d.     Announce the keynotes
d.     发布主题演讲

e.     Announce the event schedule
e.     发布活动计划

f.     Communicate highlights of various aspects of the event
f.     传达开源活动各个方面的亮点

g.     Communicate opportunities for networking, socializing, and nearby attractions
g.     告知人脉交流和社交的活动机会，附近的景点

h.     Event followup emails
h.     活动后续跟进邮件
 

**3) Lean in on the power of word of mouth:** Reach out to open source communities who will have an affinity for the topic or the event and to local open source groups to spread the word, help build audience numbers, and attract volunteers.
**3）利用口口相传的力量：** 接触对主题或活动有认同感的开源社区，以及当地的开源团体，传播信息，帮助扩大观众群体，吸引志愿者
 

*"If you're in, for example, Austin and you're holding a local event for primarily the Austin open-source community, there are a ton of companies locally that you can reach out to. Whether that is companies like Home Depot or IBM that have big open-source development centers there, or whether it's reaching out to the local tech and open-source organizations of which there are a lot,"* said Brown.
*“举个例子，如果你在奥斯汀，你正在为奥斯汀主要的开源社区举办一个本地活动，那么你可以联系到许多本地的公司。无论是像 Home Depot 或 IBM 这样在那里设有大型开源开发中心的公司，还是向数量众多的本地科技和开源组织发出邀请”*， Brown说。
 

**4) Create media partnerships:** Ideas on ways to leverage media partnerships include being added to their calendar of events, an exchange of results or services, advertise their and your events on the respective websites, ask for press coverage of the event for additional promotion for it, develop educational opportunities for the community, and other mutually beneficial activities that grow both audiences.
**4）建立媒体合作** 利用媒体合作的思路建议包括，将你的活动添加到他们的活动日程中，交换活动结果或服务，在各自的网站上宣传他们和你的活动，请求对活动的新闻报道以获取额外的宣传机会，促成社区的教育机会，以及其他可以让双方受众都获得增长的互利活动
 

**5) Cross-promote two or more events:** *"I met with the team that runs our engineering Tech Talks and asked for their assistance ahead of time. They put it on all of the channels where they promote their Tech Talks. Anything basically where they announce and promote upcoming events, they included my event as if it were one of their Tech Talks. But then we had to narrow it down some since they have quite a large following who are interested in other things,"* said Arvin.
**5）跨多个活动的宣传推广：** *“我提前与负责我们工程技术讲座的团队会面，并请求他们的帮助。他们把我的活动放在他们推广技术讲座的所有渠道上。基本上他们在任何公告和推广即将举办的活动的地方，都把我的活动当作他们的技术讲座之一来包括进去。但是后来我们必须把范围缩小一些，因为他们有很多关注其他事情的粉丝。”*， Arvin说。
 

**6) Target open source groups:** Post announcements and information on places such as the Open Source back channel and the Open Source chatter, which is to say your intranet system. Also, tag various Open Source specific projects, for example, The Python Group. Further, ask speakers to share it with their teams, their chatter page and their Slack group as well.
**6）聚焦开源人群：** 在开源后台频道和开源聊天频道等地方发布活动公告和信息，也就是你的 Intranet 内部网络。此外，给各种特定的开源项目打标签，例如，Python Group。更进一步，请求演讲者把信息分享给他们的团队，他们的聊天页面和他们的Slack群组。

However you choose to market your event, be assured that the appetite for more information and more opportunities to network has never waned despite current circumstances and challenges.
无论你选择哪些活动营销推广策略，你要确信对开源活动信息和机会的渴望一直不会衰减，不管当前情况和挑战会是怎样。
 

## Lessons Learned
## 经验教训

To the credit of the TODO group, open source communities and organizations, and open source fans, events have continued on despite the challenges. It’s only natural that such an open group would open source the lessons learned so far too:
得益于TODO group，开源社区和开源组织，以及开源粉丝们的努力，尽管面临挑战，开源活动仍在持续进行。对这样一个开放的团体来说，将迄今为止的经验教训开源出来也是理所当然的：

**1) Project sprints are increasingly of interest:** Sprints for projects are becoming increasingly popular. For example, a sprint for The Python Language is common at Python conferences. Typically, there are several days of sprints. Some are designed to accelerate headway from people who are core to the project while they are in the same physical space with each other. But some are onramps for new contributors, keeping a vital pipeline filled. And some are introductory and ideal for newcomers.
**1）项目冲刺（Project Sprint）越来越受关注** 项目的冲刺正在变得越来越受欢迎。例如，Python语言的项目冲刺在Python会议上很常见。通常，项目冲刺会持续几天。有些冲刺旨在让同一物理空间中的项目核心人员加快进展。但些冲刺是为新晋的贡献者提供的主路径的入口，保持重要的人员流水线的畅通。还有些冲刺对新来者来说是介绍性的，非常适合他们。"
 

Consider using sprints as satellite events to your conference to build feeders for projects and languages you support and need support in. But be forewarned, it is not as easy to do as it sounds.
可以考虑将冲刺作为你的会议的卫星活动，建立开源项目和开发语言的能力供应通道，这些开源项目和开发语言是你负责支持并需要支持的。但预先警告一下，这并不像听起来那么容易。
 

*"We tried and didn't work as well because Salesforce has so many different programming languages, and every team is using a different one. When we tried to make it too specific events, even those outside of Open Source, generally aren't as successful internally. The lesson is that sprints and events can be too narrow,"* said Arvin.
*“我们尝试过但效果不理想，因为Salesforce使用了许多不同的编程语言，每个团队都使用不同的语言。当我们尝试过于特定的活动时，即使是开源领域之外的活动，一般在内部也没那么成功。这个教训是冲刺和活动不能过于狭窄。”*， Arvin说。
 

**2) One day conferences tend to be a hit:** Take for example, Salesforce’s one day event planned for 50 people in San Francisco at an offsite venue. that we held it at. More than 50 people showed up and stayed the entire day. The talks were by Salesforce and other companies. Marketing was mostly grassroots with most of the messaging targeting the local community and inviting local speakers.
**2）：单天会议会很受欢迎** 例如，Salesforce在旧金山的一个非工作场地计划了一天的活动，预计有50人参加。结果有超过50人出席并停留了一整天。演讲人员来自Salesforce和其他公司。营销推广主要是草根式的，大部分信息是针对本地社区，并邀请本地演讲者。
 

*"It ended up being a huge success. We had really positive feedback around it and people stayed the whole day. It is always a win when you don't lose people halfway through the event,"* said Arvin.
*“这最后变成巨大的成功。我们得到非常正面的反馈，人们在那里呆了一整天。当你的活动进行到一半仍未有人离开时，这就是成功。”*， Arvin说。
 

**3) Maintain bonds for your projects:** Did you lose your maintainer or are they about to leave to work somewhere else?  Project contributors are bound to have a lot of questions you’ll need to answer to keep momentum going.  
**3） 维护你的项目人脉纽带：**你曾失去过你的项目维护者（maintainer）或他们准备去其他地方工作吗？项目贡献者必然会有许多问题，你需要回答这些问题以推进项目。
 

*"I think it's important to call that out. And not just in the sense of the specific instance and how that ended up being useful for the project because we had the maintainer who was moving on. But because I think that speaks to a broader theme of the importance of events,"* said Simmons.  
*“我认为强调这一点很重要。并不仅仅是在具体案例下，或者因为我们让项目维护者继续工作而让项目得益。而是因为我认为这涉及到一个更广泛的主题，即开源活动的重要性。”*， Simmons说。
 

"Especially when there's change coming with a project. Whether that's a change in the leadership or change in how it's organized, or a big new release. There are communities that have formed organically around these projects and everybody has their own stake and sense of ownership. So when a project hits a point where there's something big happening, that raises a lot of questions for other participants. Events can be an extremely useful forum for helping people address the fear of the uncertainty and organize around what's coming next," Simmons added.
“特别是当项目即将发生变化时。无论这些变化是项目管理层的变动，组织方式的变化，还是一个重大的新版本发布。这些项目周围自然形成了社区，每个人都有自己的权益和归属感。因此，当一个项目即将发送重大事件时，这会引发其他参与者的许多疑问。开源活动可以是一个极其有用的交流平台，帮助人们克服对不确定性的恐惧，并组织起来应对即将发生的事情”，Simmons补充到。
 

**4) Pivot whenever and wherever you need to:** It’s ok to pivot. Especially now when everyone is focused on adapting to a new reality. Don’t hesitate. Pivot and move on is the new fail fast.
**4）在需要时就执行转型：** 项目转型是一个正常的事情。特别是所有人都关注新形势转型的时刻。不要犹豫，转型和继续前进是新的快速试错。
 

"If you're not getting traction, or you're not getting support from the organization, or the content is off or you can’t find good speakers, or whatever the case may be that points to a likely fail for the event you had in mind, then pivot. If you're not getting support it doesn't mean it's not an important event, or that it doesn't need to happen. It just means it isn’t working right now," said Arvin.
“如果你没有获得关注，或者没有得到组织的支持，或者内容不合适，或者你找不到好的演讲者，或者是各种情况表明你设想的活动很可能会失败，那么就转变方向。如果你没有得到支持，并不意味着这不是一个重要的活动，或者不需要举办。这只说明现在它暂时行不通。”， Arvin说。

"It's okay if the end result doesn't look like the original event you had in mind. It can evolve throughout the process. And even with successful events that we've done in the past, the second one is going to look different and so is the third and fourth. We’re always going to be changing and adapting. And that's okay," Arvin added.
“如果最终的活动结果看起来与你最初设想的不同也没关系。它可以在整个过程中不断演进。即便是我们过去举办的成功活动，第二次举办时也会有所不同，第三次、第四次也是如此。我们总是在不断变化和适应。这是正常的。”， Arvin补充到。
 

**5) Curate documentation to encourage event spread:**. For example, Salesforce curates documentation on how to guides and other material on events so that smaller groups can run events on their own. Salesforce is also looking at open sourcing some of these documents to the larger community as well. But event organizers still are standing by to give advice and otherwise assist as needed.
**5）整理文档并鼓励开源活动推广：** 例如，Salesforce整理了关于开源活动指引和相关的文档，以便较小的团体可以自行举办活动。Salesforce也在考虑将这些文档的一部分开源给更大的社区。但是，开源活动组织者仍然随时待命，提供建议和必要的协助。
 

"I'm both a web developer and a community organizer and one of the things that I have come to learn, and I wish I had realized this earlier, was how hungry communities are for this kind of support," said Simmons.
“我既是web开发者也是社区组织者，有一个我逐渐了解并后悔没一早知晓的事情，就是开源社区非常需要这类帮助。”， Simmons说。
 

"Communities may not even know that they need support from event planners and organizers. But when we show up and we offer our support, I think they quickly realize that events are just as complicated in software but in very different ways. Then they are eager to be here to work with us," said Simmons.
“开源社区可能不知道他们需要来自活动规划者组织者的帮助。但当我们展示并提供帮助时，我认为他们马上意识到开源活动的复杂度和软件一样，其复杂方式还非常不同。然后他们就热切希望来这里和我们一起工作”， Simmons说。
 

**6) Blended events will be the new virtual:** Virtual events were forced to scale on the heels of a pandemic. But they are likely with us forever now, either in their pure state or as part of new, blended events. 
**6） 新的线上开源活动将会是混合模式：** 线上虚拟开源活动在疫情期间被迫规模增长。但它们可能将一直存在，不管是纯线上模式还是新型的线上线下混合模式。

One of the biggest advantages to virtual events is scale: organizers can reach much larger audiences located anywhere with an internet connection. That’s great because one of the biggest goals in open source is to grow communities and projects. 
线上虚拟开源活动的最大优点之一是其覆盖规模：组织者可以触达更广泛的受众，他们可以在任何地方需要有互联网接入。这很棒因为开源的最大目标之一就是拓展社区和项目。

*"We need to get more people trained to be the next generation of developers. Frankly we're in need of more developers now. And it's not just developers, right? It's community leaders, it's program office managers, as every company is now going to open-source as the norm, we all know that there are a ton of things that go along with that. Legal and compliance and governance and all of these things,"* said Brown.
*“我们需要培训更多的人成为下一代开发者。坦白说，我们现在需要更多的开发者。而且不仅仅是开发者，对吧？还包括社区领袖、开源项目办公室经理，因为现在每家公司都将开源作为常态，我们都知道这其中涉及许多事务，如法律、合规、治理等等。”*，Brown说 

Virtual events are a great growth facilitator. They also enable organizers to produce an event for less money and attendees to spend less money to attend. But that’s not to say that virtual events can out deliver physical events on every important touchstone.
线上虚拟活动是优秀的开源拓展方式。他们让活动组织者用更少的成本举办活动，让参与者省掉很多参会费用。但这不表示线上虚拟活动在所有重要指标上都优于线下实体活动。

*"When we look forward, now, we're seeing a strong opportunity for something hybrid. Where we can use the virtual side to bring something to a much larger group of people. That's going to provide a huge impact and benefit for attendees and hopefully help them through their careers and into the open-source community,"* Brown said.
*“当我们现在展望未来时，我们看到很强的线上线下混合的趋势。我们可以利用线上虚拟方式，将活动内容带给更广泛的人群。这将为参与者带来巨大的影响和收益，希望能帮助他们的职业生涯，并融入开源社区。”*，Brown说。
 

**So, what might a hybrid event look like?**
**那么，混合开源活动会是怎样**

*"We'll start with the virtual event and move over to our physical event, which is great, because we don't want our physical events to be an echo chamber. We've seen value come out of virtual and physical events, which is the silver lining of how we can use the virtual events to expand the region of the physical one in a hybrid model,"* said Brown.
*“我们将从线上虚拟活动开始，然后过渡到我们的线下实体活动，这是非常好的，因为我们不希望我们的实体活动成为只有一种声音的回音室。我们已经看到虚拟和实体活动带来的价值，这是我们使用混合模式虚拟活动来扩展实体活动范围的希望所在。”*，Brown说。

 

At the end of the day, events are living things, growing and dying, adapting and evolving through the years. Technologies change, audiences change, circumstances change, the needs of the event change, economics or pandemic changes, lots of things will always be shaping and reshaping how open source events are done. Accordingly, this document is also a living thing. Please check back regularly for updates.
归根结底，开源活动就像生命体一样，年复一年地生长、消亡、适应和进化。技术在变，观众在变，环境在变，活动的需求在变，经济和疫情也在变，许多因素将不断地塑造和重塑开源活动的举办方式。因此，本文档也是一个生命体。请定期回来查看更新。
