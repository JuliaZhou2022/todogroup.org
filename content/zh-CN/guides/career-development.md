Open Source Program Offices (OSPO) provide distinct value for businesses. But it is the distinctive nature of the work that makes OSPO professionals appear highly specialized or their job role difficult to categorize into traditional role definitions. Further, the industry has a lack of consensus on job titles and job descriptions between OSPO professionals, community managers and developer relations professionals, with similar roles being more or less highly prized depending upon which business is doing the hiring. Combined, these issues can make recruiting junior professionals into OSPOs more challenging, and defining an upward career path for senior talent more of an art than a science. 

开源项目办公室（OSPO）为企业提供独特的价值。但是，其工作的独特性使得 OSPO 专业人士看起来高度专业化，或者他们的职位角色很难归入传统的角色定义中。此外，行业在 OSPO 专业人士、社区经历和开发者关系专业人士之间的职位名称和职位描述方面缺乏共识，类似职位的受重视程度取决于正在招聘的企业。综合来看，这些问题使得招募初级专业人士进入 OSPOs 变得更加挑战，为高级人才定义上升的职业道路更像是一门艺术而非科学。

The purpose of this guide is to help OSPO leaders build a sustainable and rewarding career path for their employees, including helping them gather depth of skills in particular areas so they’re well prepared to develop their careers in more than one area of the business.

该指南旨在帮助 OSPO 领导者们为他们的雇员打遭可持续和可回馈的职业道路，包括帮助他们在特定领域积累深厚的技能，从而为他们在企业的多个领域发展职业生涯做好准备。

## Guide Description
## 指南描述

Several issues that affect OSPO performance, visibility and skill transferability necessary to career advancement are covered in this guide. 

本指南涵盖了影响 OSPO 绩效、可见性和对职业晋升所必需的技能迁移性的几个问题。

For example, this guide includes an exploration of where in an organization an OSPO belongs. Should it live in marketing, engineering or the CTO office? Also, what kind of skillsets are needed for the OSPO to function, and how do they translate to more traditional roles? 

例如，本指南包括了探讨 OSPO 在组织中应该归属哪个部门的问题。它是应当隶属于市场部门、工程部门还是首席技术官（CTO）办公室？此外，OSPO 的运作需要哪些技能组合，以及这些技能如何转化为更传统的角色？

Further, how can OSPOs build staff skills within the office? Can you augment OSPO skill sets by shifting people into OSPO from their former roles, whether it's product management or product marketing, or something else? 

此外，OSPO 应如何在办公室内建设员工的技能？是否可以通过将人员从前职（无论是产品经理、产品营销或者其他角色）转移到 OSPO 来增强 OSPO 技能组合？

In any case, it’s time to have a plan to cement OSPO job roles as vital elements in any organization, and as vital skills that are fully transferable to other roles throughout the organization. This guide seeks to lend assistance in that endeavor.

总之，现在是将 OSPO 职位角色巩固为任何组织的重要元素，以及可完全转移到组织内其他职位的关键技能的时候了。本指南旨在为这一努力提供帮助。

Most importantly, in order to recruit and retain talent in crucial roles, OSPO leaders must proactively help staff members plan their career advancement strategy. This guide will help OSPO leaders to:

最重要的是，为了给关键职位招聘和留住人才，OSPO 领导者们必须积极主动地帮助员工们规划他们的职业发展策略。该指南将帮助 OSPO 领导者们：

* Map staff’s diverse job skills and responsibilities in traditional business terms;
* 将职工的多样化职业技能和责任与传统商业术语相对应。

* Understand how an OSPO specific job ladder can support the career development of and retention of key staff, with tips on how to get started creating one;
* 了解 OSPO 特有的职位阶梯如何支持关键员工职业发展和保留，并提供有关如何开始创建该职业发展阶梯的建议。

* Support the growth and development of their staff members’ personal brands as part their OSPO public-facing work responsibilities. 
* 作为 OSPO 面向公众工作职责的一部分，帮助员工发展和提升个人品牌。

This guide aims to assist OSPO leadership in advancing their careers and leveraging the skills they have gained across these traditional roles as they seek new career challenges. 

本指南旨在帮助 OSPO 领导者提升职业生涯，并且利用他们在担任传统角色时获得的技能，寻求新的职业挑战。

## Defining the scope of work for OSPO roles
## 为 OSPO 角色定义工作范围

*"When I think about career development for my team, and this is true about anyone who's building an open source office within a company in general, I’m thinking about how can we be very intentional about either expanding or contracting the scope of our office in order to facilitate some of the other work that needs to be done,"* said **Will Norris, Open Source Lead at Twitter. Formerly Open Source Engineering Manager at Google**

*“当我为我的团队考虑职业发展时，这对于在公司内部建立开源项目的负责人来说都适用，我认为关键在于我们该如何有意识地扩大或缩小办公室的职能范围，以促进其他需要完成的工作，* **Twitter 的开源负责人 Will Noriirs 说。他此前担任 Google 的开源工程经理。**

Alongside the OSPO scope expanding, contracting or changing over time comes the added challenge in defining the scope of work in specific open source tasks when so much of it occurs outside of traditional job descriptions and even outside the organization itself. Examples include an engineer who is contributing code to an external project, or someone who's doing community management, or someone who's doing other kinds of things that are more externally focused.

随着 OSPO 的职能范围随着时间推移而扩展、收缩或者变化，另一个挑战在于定义特定开源任务的工作范围，因为其中有许多工作超出了传统职位描述的范围，甚至超出了组织本身的范畴。例如，工程师为外部项目贡献代码，或者从事社区管理的人员，或者做其他更注重外部工作的人员。

*"When you have someone who's doing a lot of their work externally, we've found that it's a real challenge to help provide visibility for those artifacts to help those individuals get the appropriate credit for it to help grow their careers,"* said Norris. 

Norris 说：*“当有人做了大量外部工作时，我们发现，如何帮助这些成果被看见，从而使他们获得应有的认可并助力其职业发展，这是一个真正的挑战。”*

One of the ways Google addresses that is with an open source council the company started in 2019. The council is composed of representatives who are working in different open source roles throughout the company so they can collaborate on solving common challenges.

Google 应对这一挑战的方法之一是通过一个开源委员会，该委员会由公司成立于 2019 年。该委员会由来自公司不同开源角色的代表组成，以便他们能够合作解决共同的挑战。

*"We have a new working group right now that is focused on exactly how we can help provide visibility into the work of individuals who are doing more external facing work than internal. Some of that is actually changing the job ladders at Google, getting language in there to really give credit to community contributions and to open source,"* Norris explained.

Norris 解释道：*“我们现在有一个新的工作小组，其重点正是如何帮助提升那些更注重外部工作而非内部工作的人员的工作可见度。其中一些举措实际上是改变谷歌的职业发展阶梯，加入相关语言，真正认可社区贡献和开源工作。”*

Developing a useful open source career ladder is not as simple and straightforward as listing job duties and responsibilities. And yet OSPO managers have to start somewhere.

开发有用的开源职业阶梯并不是如列举工作职责和责任那么简单和直接。但是 OSPO 经理们必须从某个地方开始着手。

*"Part of the process we did was to identify a job class that already existed in Red Hat in technical program management. That’s because human resources couldn't create a new job classification out of whole cloth. They have to use industry benchmarks such as those prescribed by IEEE or other industry guides,"* said **Deborah Bryant, senior director of the Open Source Program Office at Red Hat.**

**红帽开源项目办公室高级总监德博拉·布莱恩特（Deborah Bryant）说**：*“我们所做工作的一部分是确定红帽（Red Hat）内部已经存在的技术项目管理的职位类别。这是因为人力资源部门不能凭空创造一个新的职位分类，他们必须采用行业标准，比如由 IEEE 或其他行业指南规定的标准。”*

However, the path forward is further muddied by the job titles a typical OSPO uses too. 

但是，开源项目办公室（OSPO）通常使用的职位名称也进一步模糊了前进的道路。

*"No one really likes to use the term community manager, because we all know you can't actually manage a community. A community has a life of its own. It has a mind of its own and a will of its own,"* said Bryant.

布莱恩特（Bryant）说：*“没有人会真正喜欢‘社区经理’这个头衔，因为我们都知道你实际上无法管理一个社区。社区有它自己的生命，有自己的想法和意愿。”*

*"You're really there to support. You're not there to manage. So it's always been debatable about how you name it. But we landed on community architect,"* Bryant added.

布莱恩特（Bryant）补充道：*“你实际上是去支持社区，而不是管理它。因此，如何命名这个职位一直存在争议。但是我们选择了‘社区架构师’这个头衔。”*

While clarifying job titles is an essential starting point, pinning those jobs to existing job descriptions often remains an exercise in confusion. Yet, adding new job classes for OSPO specifically is quite commonly a near insurmountable hill to climb in many organizations. But that doesn’t mean the task is impossible.

尽管厘清职位头衔是必不可少的第一步，但将这些职位与现有的职位描述相匹配往往是一项让人感到困惑的工作。然而，在许多组织中，专门为开源项目办公室（OSPO）添加新的职位类型通常会成为一个不可逾越的障碍。但这并不意味着这项任务不可能完成。

Bryant was instrumental in developing Red Hat’s career ladder for OSPO from the outset. It didn’t exist when she joined the company in 2014, but the internal demand for it was already high. She says they used the engineering career ladder as their initial framework, but it wasn’t an exact fit.

布莱恩特（Bryant）从一开始就在发展红帽开源项目办公室（OSPO）的职业阶梯方面起着重要作用。在她 2014 年加入公司时这一职业阶梯并不存在，但是内部的需求已经很高。她说，他们使用工程职业阶梯作为他们的初始框架，但是这并不完全适合。

*"The most significant difference was that community managers don't actually produce code. Sometimes they do it incidental to the work, sometimes they do it as a hobby, but their core responsibility is not producing code,"* Bryant said.

布莱恩特（Bryant）说：*“最显著的的区别在于社区经理实际上不产出代码。有时他们会在工作中偶尔编写代码，有时他们会将其作为兴趣爱好，但是他们的核心职责不是产出代码。”*

*"And because that's such a critical part of an engineer's career path, it made it difficult for a community manager then to move up through a promotional process where a part of the decision process and the requirements to be able to move in a career would have been based on, in part, not all, a code contribution,"* she added. 

她补充道：*“因为产出代码是工程师职业发展道路上的关键组成部分，这使得社区管理者很难通过晋升流程得到提升，因为在晋升决策和职业晋升要求中，有一部分是基于代码贡献的，尽管并非全部。”*

## Refitting existing career ladders for open source
## 重新调整现有职业阶梯以适应开源环境

Bryant said she and her team set out to create a career ladder that reflected those elements. They refitted the engineering career ladder to reflect similar skills for community managers. 

布莱恩特说：“她和她的团队着手创建一个反映这些元素的职业发展路径。他们调整了工程职业发展路径，使社区经理的职业发展路径也能反应类似的技能。”

*"Basically, there's a competency matrix that shows where someone's skill level should be in leadership, in collaboration, in community contribution, in technical acumen. And then, along that matrix, it will describe what the person's skill level should be at. So we took that very complex competency matrix and modified it to reflect what we thought some of the skills would be for community managers or what we call community architects,"* Bryant said.

布莱恩特说：*“基本上，有一个能力矩阵，展示了一个人的领导能力，合作能力，社区贡献能力和技术敏锐度应该达到什么水平。然后，在这个矩阵上，会描述这个人应该达到的技能水平。因此，我们把这个非常复杂的能力矩阵进行修改，以反映我们社区经理或者我们所说的社区架构师应具备的一些技能。”*

It took considerable and widespread collaboration to shape the career ladder from the beginning and finalize it as a fair and useful hiring and promotion tool in the end.

从一开始就采用大量和广泛的合作来塑造职业阶梯，最终它会成为有用的招聘和升职工具。

*"It went through peer review and a pretty deliberate process to make sure that not only did it create a career path and an ability to celebrate someone's accomplishments in community architecture, but it also corresponded with an opportunity to increase their compensation in that model within the company,"* Bryant said.

布莱恩特说：“这个职业阶梯经过了同行评审和一个非常严谨的流程，以确保它不仅能为社区架构领域的人员创造职业发展道路，表彰他们的成就，而且还能使他们在公司内部通过这种模式获得更高的薪酬。”

Once the career ladder was completed for the OSPO team and people were promoted accordingly, other departments with open source talent showed interest in it too.

一旦 为 OSPO 团队完成了职业阶梯的设定，并且根据此标注进行了人员晋升，其他拥有开源人才的部门也对此表现出了兴趣。

*"That's been really gratifying to see that get adopted by other teams in other areas of the company,"* Bryant said.

布莱恩特说：*“当看到该职业阶梯被公司其他领域的其他团队也采用，真是令人非常欣慰。”*

True to open source roots and Red Hat’s culture, the company’s career guide is a work in progress, influenced by many voices working together towards an ever-changing definition of a useful tool. But whether you are just starting to develop an OSPO career guide or are working on one of many iterations, Bryant advises starting with the same focal point.

秉承开源的初衷和红帽公司的文化，公司的职业指南是一项持续进行的工作，受到许多声音的影响，大家共同努力不断完善对实用工具的定义。布莱恩特还建议，无论你是刚开始制定 OSPO 职业发展指南，还是正在对其进行多次迭代，都应该从相同的核心点开始着手。

*"Start with a good understanding of what you really need from your open source program team. It may not be the same for every company. Some companies work mostly on a regulatory side in terms of license compliance and some other work. My team doesn't work on that. For me, there's a certain core set of skills that are important to me, as there are in other offices,"* Bryant says. 

布莱恩特说道：*“首先要透彻理解您真正需要开源项目团队做什么。这可能因公司而异。有些公司主要在监管方面开展工作，如许可证合规和其他工作。我的团队并不从事这些工作。对我来说，有一组核心技能对我来说很重要，其他办公室也一样。”*

## Integrating the unique with the standard
## 将独特与标准相结合

Organizational variances are common even though patterns in how most companies think about and manage open source are similar. For example, all companies must decide how to handle compliance with open source software distribution, code contributions and code releases. There are also security, talent recruitment, developer relations, and other functions that companies must assign to a team to ensure all goes well. 

尽管大多数公司思考和管理开源的模式存在相似之处，但组织差异仍普遍存在。例如，所有公司都必须决定如何处理与开源软件分发、代码贡献和代码发布相关的合规性问题。此外，公司还必须将安全、人才招聘、开发者关系和其他只能分配给某个团队，以确保一切顺利。

"There's all these different things that every company deals with. But the subset of those things that happen to fall within the open source office is what's different at every company," said Norris. Google’s OSPO is an example of a team focused on engineering and compliance. A separate team handles the program side at Google. 

诺里斯说：“每家公司都会面对各种不同的问题。但恰好落在开源办公室职责范围内的事情，每家公司的情况都不仅相同。”谷歌的开源项目办公室就是一个专注于工程和合规的团队的例子。在谷歌，另有一个团队负责处理项目方面的工作。

Norris said that while some companies prefer the compliance and legal side of open source to be generally handled by the legal team, Google has a legal team within its open source office. 

诺里斯说：“尽管一些公司偏向于由法务团队来总体负责开源合规性和法律事务，但谷歌在起开源办公室内部设有一个法务团队。”

Another example: some companies choose to make their developer relations (AKA DevRel) group part of their open source office, others do the opposite. Still others, like Google, keep the two groups separate.

另一个例子：一些公司选择让开发者关系（也称为 DevRel）团队成为其开源办公室的一部分，而其他公司则相反。还有一些公司，例如谷歌，则让两个团队保持独立。

"At Google, we're very closely related. And then we have a long history of those two groups working very closely together, but we're actually not part of the same group," Norris explained.

诺里斯解释道：“在谷歌，我们关系很密切。同时，这两个团队长期以来一直紧密合作，但我们实际上并不是同一团队的一部分。”

The relationship between standards and open source software also tends to be very close, but companies may decide to consolidate standards within their open source office, or distribute it among several teams. 

标准和开源软件之间的关系也往往十分紧密，但是公司可能会决定在开源办公室内统一标准，或者将其分发给多个团队。

"At Google, that's actually distributed and mostly for a historical reason, since that is the way that standards have worked at Google," Norris said. 

诺里斯说道：“在谷歌，标准是由多个团队来负责的，这主要是出于历史原因，因为谷歌的标准工作一直以来都是这样进行的。”

The diversity in how companies organize open source duties and responsibilities between individuals and teams drives the development of their OSPO career ladders.

公司如何组织个人和团队之间的开源职责和任务的多样性，驱动了其开源项目办公室职业阶梯的发展。

"Within our open source programs office we don't have specific job ladders or even lenses on our job ladders that are unique to open source. Pretty much everyone in our open source office is either a traditional software engineer, or a program manager. So we use Google's standard software engineering and program management ladders. And one of the reasons we do that is because at Google, as a company, has always valued mobility within the company," Norris added. 

诺里斯补充道：“在我们的开源项目办公室内部，我们没有为开源设置特定的职业阶梯或者职业阶梯视角。我们的开源办公室里的员工几乎都是传统的软件工程师或项目经理。所以我们使用谷歌的标准软件工程师和项目经理职业阶梯。我们这么做的原因之一是，谷歌作为一家公司，一直重视员工在公司内部的移动性。”

Ultimately, organizing the OSPO and integrating it with related functions requires an unwavering focus on the company’s mission and goals.

最终，组织开源项目办公室并将其与相关职能整合在一起，需要坚定不移地关注公司的使命和目标。

For example, Google OSPO’s core mission is to bring all of the value of open source to Google, and all of the resources of Google to open source. 

例如，谷歌开源项目办公室的核心使命是将开源的所有价值带给谷歌，同时将谷歌的所有资源用于开源。

"That mission doesn't change. In recruiting, I'm really looking for someone who cares about the problems of open source, and the kinds of things that we're doing. We love adding fresh perspectives too. The tools that we use will change, the languages that we program in will change. Plus Google has a lot of homegrown systems in our engineering stack, so most new employees are going to have to learn a lot of that stuff anyway. That makes it totally okay to have some folks in our open source office who are new to open source too," said Norris. 

诺里斯说道：“这一使命不会改变。在招聘中，我真的在寻找那些关心开源问题以及我们正在做的事情的人。我们也欢迎加入新的观点。我们使用的工具将变化，我们编程使用的语言也会改变。此外，谷歌的工程栈中有很多自主研发的系统，因此大多数新员工都需要学习很多这些东西。这使得我们的开源办公室中有一些对开源不太了解的人也是完全可以的。”

Whether OSPO staff and recruits are deeply experienced or brand new to open source, mapping skill categories to resemble the standard, traditional roles but that also integrate the unique skills and duties associated with open source are essential to talent recruitment, retention, and career advancement within the office specifically and in the organization and industry at large. 

无论开源项目办公室的员工和招募人员是否具有丰富的开源经验，还是新手，将技能类别映射到类似的标准和传统的角色，同时整合与开源相关的独特的技能和职责，这对于办公室内部、整个组织以及整个行业的人才招聘、留任和职业发展至关重要。

## Mapping Skill Categories
## 映射技能类别

Senior leaders need to help their reports recognize how their skills and daily work map to the work done by others in the organization, and how their work complements those functions while adding distinct value to the business. 

高级领导者需要帮助他们的下属认识到，他们的技能和日常工作是如何与组织中其他人的工作相匹配的，以及他们的工作是如何在补充这些职能的同时为业务增添独特价值的。

*"We classify all of our OSPO staff as technical program managers because that's a well-understood skill set in technical organizations and because our OSPO lives in engineering. And so there are CDs of steps within that, from PM-1 all the way to PM-6, which is like a senior director,"* said **Nithya Ruff, Executive Director, OSPO at Comcast.**

Indeed, Ruff advocates for OSPOs to report to the CTO or the SVP of engineering, rather than to marketing or legal.

*"OSPOs should have a very high reporting structure because it's a pretty big cultural change and you cannot do that without having support from the top. It must be a strategic and important initiative for the company. Having that kind of air cover is important,"* said Ruff. 

In any case, the first step is breaking down the skills an OSPO staff member uses in their daily functions and fitting those into well understood skill buckets in other company departments or divisions.

*"From there, employees can work with their managers to grow their skills in domains that support OSPOs service work within the company while deepening their own expertise in a particular area,"* said **Leslie Hawthorn, Senior Principal Technical Program Manager, Open Source Program Office, Office of the CTO at Red Hat.**

## Example: Mapping the Skills of a Community Manager

Job titles at Comcast are closely equated to more traditional roles in engineering to assist in identifying skill sets in easily recognizable terms. The succession steps are also similar. For example OSPO staff are classified as technical program managers and progress on a scale starting at entry level PM-1 and ending at PM-6, the equivalent of a senior director.

*"We can pass people through that route but unless there are big divisions in a company where you can say, okay, you can go be the OSPO leader in division A, then it's very hard to find a role for yourself beyond just being at that top end of your community manager role or top end of your compliance manager role,"* said Ruff. 

Internally, the job title is always program manager at Comcast and closely tied to engineering roles, but externally the titles are aligned with other OSPOs, according to Ruff. The external titles are commonly community managers, compliance managers, or devrel, which is short for developer relations. 

*"It is important to parse the newer title of dev rel out and determine what it means to OSPOs and in terms of traditional role counterparts. Is it the same or different as a community manager? Can the OSPO charter be broadened to include developer relations or to help developers be more effective on different fronts, not just on open source? What about DevOps and agile and other things of that nature? Can the OSPO expand its capacity to fit all that and to encourage the growth of those skillsets too?"* asked Ruff.

For the moment, many companies employ community managers to focus on program management for their open source activities. The tasks for each community manager vary from organization to organization, but the work falls into well understood skill buckets.

1. **Product Management, Marketing and Sales:** Product management requires knowledge, use and management of metrics, user feedback and feature requests, and bridge building between power users and developers for product improvement and innovation. Product marketing requires raising overall awareness of the project, developing and implementing content strategy (blogs, social media, YouTube videos, etc), and measuring reach and engagement. These are the same skills used by many Community Management professionals in managing and promoting an open source project.

Community management professionals also use skills similar to those used in product sales. These professionals are "selling" a very discerning audience on the nature and virtues of the project and the reasons their “prospect” should contribute to or use this project rather than another. Many community management professionals must be successful at collecting leads at events, ensuring their presentations and content comes across as genuinely educational rather than as a blatant sales pitch, and that their one-on-one relationships are supportive of deal flow, be that deal onboarding a new contributor or executing a new sales contract. 

2. **Strategic Partner Management:** Open source communities may include many volunteers, but that doesn’t mean they don’t function on business principles. Corporate partners are an important part of a project’s success, and they expect mutual benefit. Community management pros must be attuned to the goals of corporate partners and how they align with the goals of the community as well as with other corporate partners. Management issues can be delicate to handle but they also must be resolved to the benefit of all and not just a few. Preferably without losing a partner or sponsor. 

3. **Evangelism and Sponsor Relations:** Evangelism differs from sales in that it is focused on promoting the community and the work of others rather than directly on the project. It involves, among other things, developing coordinated community and project messaging, determining the best means to get the messaging distributed internally and externally, and actively promoting the work of other people and organizations who are advocating for the project. Managing sponsor relations to aid with fundraising for project activities or an affiliated Foundation is a top priority. This requires a near-constant external sponsorship search to support events and a pressing need to develop protocols and policies to determine which sponsors are most appropriate.

4. **Field Enablement and Support:** Many community management professionals also provide support for project members ranging from technical assistance to dispute resolutions. A big part of most community management professionals’ duties is resolving conflicts between the various volunteer members. This requires both policy-making skills and conflict resolution skills. Further, new members need to be onboarded, welcomed, and encouraged so that they stay interested and contribute to the community in meaningful ways. Talent recruitment and retention are also important functions to ensure the community thrives and the project gains market respect and broad support. 

Community managers also provide field support as technical experts for customers. Further, they develop processes designed to provide educational services to Solution Architects and solicit code contributions from customers. These skills are currently in high demand in every organization.

Documentation is essential to the success of any project. The skills necessary to provide or oversee documentation include writing, vetting, distribution, and delineating corporate value versus community value within the documentation.  Community management professionals may also find themselves to be proficient editors and good at finding and recruiting writers to focus on documentation. 

5. **Finance and Budgeting:** Most community managers are responsible for budgets that cover everything from convening events to T&E (travel and expenses) for the talks they give at conferences. Budgets must be balanced and allocated fairly. Some examples of tough budget provisioning are determining how to reimburse community contributors globally, maximizing return on spend for marketing and other activities, and maintaining a financial cushion to enable a fast response to opportunities as warranted. 

The various professional roles in community management entail some or all of these functions and skills. Yet their skills are rarely itemized so that they can be recognized, developed and promoted separately as noted accomplishments worthy of job advancement. By itemizing these skills and experiences, the resulting buckets labeled with traditional job roles will give each report a very good idea where their strengths and weaknesses lay, and where their preferences are in particular task categories. 

This information will go far in selecting and directing a path aimed at progressing up the career ladder. It will also be valuable to the OSPO senior leader looking to build out a job ladder for those in their organization. 

## Retaining and Promoting Your OSPO Professionals: Job Ladders

OSPO staff are in high demand. Yet it is often easier for them to change employers in order to advance their careers than to move ahead where they are. While such career moves are understandable, they are counterproductive for the organizations that are left behind.

*"A lot of us tend to circulate in the industry. That’s because currently the main way to grow is to move to a position of open source program office leader in another company, typically one that is just beginning to start their open source office. And that's a great jump because then you become the leader and you start your own team,"* said Ruff.

Ultimately it is the companies that offer the highest rungs in the career ladder that tend to net big talent. 

*"In my case, I came in as a senior director and then was promoted to executive director, and then the next path becomes vice-president and chief open source officer,"* Ruff explained.

But most organizations, a chief open source officer or a VP type of role isn’t merited. More often the top positions are director or senior director roles. 

*"You can also broaden these roles to take on open source standards, or join other open innovation work at universities or at other research projects that the company invests in externally. That then becomes a nice meaty role,"* says Ruff. 

*"I believe that at Microsoft, legal counsel has open source standards as well as open source work under the same umbrella. So I can see that kind of consolidating becoming a broader charter for the open-source program office,"* Ruff added.

But even when OSPO professionals do move to a new organization, opportunities to advance to executive director, VP or Chief Open Source Officer are few. 

*"I've seen OSPO members go on to become executive directors at foundations like Guy Martin did. He went from being an OSPO leader at Autodesk to being an executive director at Oasis Open. And Shubhra Kar went from Samsung to the Linux Foundation. Those are the two routes I've seen work, but I haven't seen anything else beyond those,"* said Ruff. 

## Guide reports on building their personal brand

It’s no secret that open source professionals are in high demand across industries. But that doesn’t mean individuals or their projects can necessarily prosper without active and sustained promotion.

In order to gain the recognition and visibility needed for opportunities to find any given individual – or for that individual to promote themselves to higher opportunities, they must actively promote their personal brand. 

The returns from OSPO leaders guiding reports on how to build their brand are equally strong for the team, project, and company too. When OSPO leaders actively and visibly demonstrate an interest in their reports’ career development, individual and team morale and performance improve significantly. As reports become more recognizable and respected brands, the project’s brand rises too. 

Further, a large part of any project’s success is attributable to its ability to attract and retain developers and other professionals. Having professionals on your staff with highly visible and respected personal brands will go far in attracting more talent to your project. 

OSPO leaders can also lighten their own workloads and multiply project and company branding efforts by sending their reports out on speaking opportunities and for public appearances representing the company. By actively assisting reports in building a strong public persona, OSPO leaders ensure everyone wins. 

## OSPO Leader Networking

Successful OSPO leaders network with their peers to promote themselves, mentor other leaders, and discover new ways to support their own reports. The TODO Group is "the great watering hole for OSPO leaders and frankly all OSPO members," said Ruff.

The focus in this type of networking is on common issues, challenges, and successes. Competitors not only work together, they seek out such opportunities to advance their own projects in the most efficient way possible. Open source competencies are viewed as separate and apart from core intellectual property (IP) or protected IP. 

*"Just recently, three or four OSPOs came to me wanting to compare notes. Disney, one of our competitors, asked to compare notes on our respective OSPOs. Verizon Media, another competitor, did the same. And so did JP Morgan Chase & Co and Office Depot, both of which were just setting up their OSPOs. We're happy to mentor and support them."* said Ruff. 

*"I think that's wonderful. And we were very candid with each other because there is nothing secret about it and we want them to succeed. We want this whole industry of media and entertainment to succeed"* Ruff added. 

## Mapping futures

OSPOs win on several fronts when they crystalize career paths for staff. Skill sets within the office expand making it possible to do more with more, even if the head count doesn’t grow too. Employee experience improves dramatically which in turn improves both recruitment and retention rates. Professional networks grow larger and stronger as more reports come into their own leadership roles later. Succession plans become easier tasks. Organizations benefit from expanding and maturing skill sets as they move forward with their open source projects and plans.

When OSPO managers take the time and make the effort to shape clear career paths for their staff, everyone wins.
