title: Building an Inclusive Open Source Community
标题: 打造一个包容性的开源社区
---

Diversity and inclusion are vital to the future of open source communities . Projects grow and thrive -- and perform better technically and economically – when contributors with diverse perspectives, experiences, and skill sets participate. Open source communities seek to be open; this means they want everyone in the community who wants to contribute to feel welcome to do so regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, age, religion, class origin, regional origin, educational background, political affiliation, or economic status. Open source communities can apply best practices to their communities that promote inclusiveness and diversity. To address these critical issues takes the strength of the collective community. Together, we can increase awareness, and subsequently address the representation gap—to benefit us all.

多样性和包容性对开源社区的未来至关重要。当具有不同视角、经验和技能集的贡献者参与进来时，项目才会发展壮大，同时在技术和经济方面表现得更出色。开源社区力求开放;这意味着他们想要社区中任何想要做出贡献的人都受到欢迎，无论其性别、性别认同、性取向、残疾、种族、民族、年龄、宗教、阶级出身、地域出身、教育背景、政治派别或者经济地位。开源社区可以在其社区中采用最佳实践来促进包容性和多样性。解决这些关键问题需要整个社区的力量。齐心协力，我们可以提高认识，进而解决代表性不足的问题，让所有人从中受益。

This guide outlines why and how to build a diverse and inclusive community of individual contributors and project leadership. You’ll learn how to frame a project for inclusiveness; how to set goals and measure progress; how to protect your community from bad actors; and gain tactics for increasing diversity.

该指南概述了为何以及如何构建一个由个人贡献者和项目领导层组成的多元化和包容性的。你将学习如何为项目制定包容性框架；如何设定目标并衡量进展；如何保护您的社区免受不良行为者的侵害；以及获得增加多样性的策略。

### Diversity and inclusion are important
### 多元化和包容性非常重要

Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) align with the ethos of open source communities. Open source invites all people to benefit from and participate in the creation of code. But open source projects often don't include many people, particularly women and underrepresented groups. This misaligns with "open-ness" and it makes open source communities less effective. Research shows that teams with diverse members and those that are more inclusive, perform better, innovate more, and produce more profitable outcomes.

多元化和包容性（D&I）与开源社区的精神相辅相成。开源邀请所有人受益以及参与代码创作。但是开源项目通常不包括多少人，尤其是女性和弱势群体。这与“开放性”不符，并使得开源社区效力降低。研究表明，拥有多元化成员，以及更具有包容性的团队表现得更好，更具创新性，以及产生更具收益的成果。

A 2017 McKinsey & Company [report](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity?cid=soc-web) found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on their executive teams were 15% more likely to deliver above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, while those with ethnic and cultural diversity were 33% more likely to outperform. The reverse is also true: "The penalty for not being diverse on both measures persists," according to the report. Companies in the bottom quartile on both gender and ethnic diversity “are more likely to underperform their industry peers on profitability.” They underperformed by 29% in 2017, the McKinsey analysts found.

麦肯锡公司在 2017 年发布的一份[报告](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity?cid=soc-web)中发现，执行团队中性别多样性最高的前 25% 的公司比后 25% 的公司高出 15% 的可能性获得平均水平之上的盈利，而种族和文化多元化高的比那些种族和文化多元化低的公司高出 33% 的可能性表现出色。报告还指出，情况相反的情况也成立：“在这两个方面缺乏多元化都会带来负面影响”。 在性别和种族多样性处于后 25% 的公司“更有可能在盈利能力方面逊色于业内同行”。麦肯锡分析师发现，他们在 2017 年的业绩低于行业平均水平 29%。

Evidence also points to greater levels of diversity leading to higher levels of innovation. "We wanted to know whether companies with policies encouraging the promotion and retention of a diverse workforce – in terms of gender, race and sexual orientation – also perform better at developing innovative products and services. The short answer is that they do," [said Richard Warr, co-author of a research report](https://news.ncsu.edu/2018/01/diversity-boosts-innovation-2018/) and head of the Department of Business Management in NC State’s Poole College of Management. “To be clear, we found that there is a causative link – it’s not just a correlation,” Warr says. “And the finding extends across a broad range of industry sectors.” These findings are consistent with a [2004 University of Michigan Study](http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~spage/pnas.pdf) that revealed that groups of diverse problem solvers can outperform groups of high-ability problem solvers.

证据也表明更高的多元化水平能带来更高的创新水平。“我们想知道拥有鼓励提升和留住多元化员工（在性别、种族和性取向方面）政策的公司，是否在开发创新产品和服务方面也表现得更好？简而言之，答案是肯定的。”“北卡罗州立大学 Poole 管理学院工商管理系主任、[研究报告合著者理查德·沃尔（Richard Warr）说](https://news.ncsu.edu/2018/01/diversity-boosts-innovation-2018/)”。沃尔说，“需要明确的是，我们发现这是一种因果关系，而不仅仅是相关性。”“这一发现还适用于广泛的行业领域。”这些发现与 [2004 年密歇根大学（University of Michigan Study）的研究成果](http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~spage/pnas.pdf)一致，该研究表明，多元化问题解决者组成的团队的表现要优于由高能力问题解决者组成的团队。

Despite the overwhelming evidence that diversity and inclusion deliver significant advantages, the representation of women and other under represented in the tech industry continues to lag. Research from the National Center for Women and Information Technology shows that women comprised only [26% of the computing workforce in 2018](https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/btn_05092019_web.pdf). According to [a report](https://www.computerscience.org/resources/women-in-computer-science/) by ComputerScience.org, "the percentage of women working in computer science-related professions has steadily declined since the 1990s, dropping from 35% to 25% in the last 15 years." Yet, representation of women in the workforce at large is the exact opposite: women are 47% of today’s workforce, as compared to 38% in the 1970s. The problem is not confined to finding talent to recruit, but in retaining talent as well.

尽管大量证据表明多样性和包容性带来巨大优势，但是女性和其他代表性不足的群体在科技行业的代表性仍然落后。来自美国全国妇女与信息技术中心 (National Center for Women and Information Technology) 的研究表明，女性在 [2018 年的计算机行业劳动力中仅占 26%](https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/btn_05092019_web.pdf)。根据 ComputerScience.org 的[一份报告](https://www.computerscience.org/resources/women-in-computer-science/)，自 1990 年代以来，从事计算机相关职业的女性比例在稳步下降，在过去 15 年间从 35% 下降到 25%。”然而，女性在整体劳动力中的比例确恰恰相反：女性占当今劳动力的 47%，而 1970 年代为 38%。问题不仅限于招聘人才，还在于留住人才。

### The unique challenges faced in open source communities
### 开源社区面临的独特挑战

Women are underrepresented in the computing workforce (26% according to the 2018 study cited above) but the numbers are even more concerning in open source communities, where women account for approximately 10-11% of contributors (according to [data](https://blog.bitergia.com/2016/04/25/openstack-genderdiversity-technical-contributions-analysis/) from Bitergia). At first glance a diverse and inclusive culture would appear to be a natural fit for open source communities, but that is not the case—obstacles such as bias, stereotyping, bullying, online harassment, and turf protections continue to hold back the true potential of ‘open’. "One thing many respondents said drives them away from open source projects are negative interactions such as rudeness, name-calling, stereotyping, and—at the more extreme end of the spectrum—stalking and outright harassment. Open source has a reputation for being aggressive," Frannie Zlotnick, the GitHub data scientist who led a 2017 research project on gender bias in pull request acceptances, [told](https://www.wired.com/2017/06/diversity-open-source-even-worse-tech-overall/) Wired.

女性在计算机行业劳动力占比较低（根据上述 2018 年的研究，占比为 26%），但在开源社区中，这一数字更令人担忧，女性贡献者仅占大约 10%-11%（根据 Bitergia 的[数据](https://blog.bitergia.com/2016/04/25/openstack-genderdiversity-technical-contributions-analysis/)）。乍一看，多元化和包容性的文化似乎与开源社区天然契合，但事实并非如此——偏见、刻板印象、欺凌、网络骚扰和领地保护等障碍仍然阻碍着“开放”的真正潜力。“许多受访者表示，驱使他们远离开源项目的原因之一是消极互动，例如粗鲁、辱骂、刻板印象，以及更极端的情况——跟踪和公然骚扰。开源项目以攻击性强而闻名”，领导了 2017 年关于拉取请求接受度中性别偏见研究项目的 GitHub 数据科学家弗兰妮·兹洛特尼克（Frannie Zlotnick）[告诉](https://www.wired.com/2017/06/diversity-open-source-even-worse-tech-overall/)连线杂志。

Companies depend on open source software for their products and infrastructure. In 2017, the Linux Foundation reported that over [80 percent](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2017/09/chaoss-project-creates-tools-to-analyze-software-development-and-measure-open-source-community-health/) of the software used in any technology product or service was open source. Open source is vital to the technology industry, but are open source communities  healthy? The open source industry is looking at ways to assess project health and stability.  As an example, the CHAOSS Project, [announced](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2017/09/chaoss-project-creates-tools-to-analyze-software-development-and-measure-open-source-community-health/) by the Linux Foundation in September 2017, establishes standard, implementation-agnostic metrics to gauge the overall health of open source communities. One of the key metrics they look at are Diversity and Inclusivity. They’re read the research; D&I is an essential part of a project’s overall health.

公司的产品和基础设施严重依赖于开源软件。在 2017 年，Linux 基金会报道在任何技术产品或者服务中使用的软件有超过 [80%](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2017/09/chaoss-project-creates-tools-to-analyze-software-development-and-measure-open-source-community-health/) 是开源的。开源对技术产业是至关重要的，但是开源社区是否健康？开源产业正在寻求评估项目健康和稳定性的方法。例如，Linux 基金会于 2017 年 9 月[宣布](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2017/09/chaoss-project-creates-tools-to-analyze-software-development-and-measure-open-source-community-health/)的 CHAOSS 项目，旨在建立标准且与具体实现无关的指标，来衡量开源社区的整体健康状况。他们关注的核心指标之一是多元化和包容性。他们研究过相关调查，认为多元化和包容性是项目整体健康的重要组成部分。

While the business case for diversity and inclusion in open source communities is strong, solving the challenges and building a more open culture of individual contributors, maintainers, and project leadership is undeniably challenging. Open source communities present unique challenges because of the way they are created, managed, and sustained over time.

尽管在开源社区中多元化和包容性的商业价值很强大，但解决挑战并为个人贡献者、维护者和项目领导层建立一个更开放的文化确实困难重重。由于开源社区的创建、管理和长期维护方式独特，因此面临着独特的挑战。

Unlike creating a workforce, an open source community is not hired. A project simply invites the world. It doesn’t select, it accepts. In this unstructured and unplanned way, the community evolves over time. Unlike the workplace, open source communities do not have the same mechanisms to create shared culture. Community members are working with people who may be working for competitors, may reside in very dissimilar cultures, and may have little desire to work well together. Open source communities may lack a leadership mechanism to govern behavior and resolve conflicts. As Gil Yehuda, senior director of Open Source at Verizon Media explains, "Open source projects tend to reward technical skills more so than leadership or management skills. When conflicts come up in a project, the project leaders might not know how to resolve an on-line conflict effectively." Nithya Ruff, senior director, Open Source Practice at Comcast and a member of the Board of Directors at The Linux Foundation, agrees, “So it is unfair to expect them to become great leaders. In some cases, it may be a matter of pairing them with knowledge and best practices. In other cases it might amount to making sure that the project has both a technical leader and a community leader who's able to bring those types of skill sets to the project. We need to bring issues and options out in discussions so that we enable maintainers to do the right thing.”

与建立一支员工队伍不同，开源社区并不是通过招聘形式构建的。开源项目仅是向全世界发出邀请。它不挑选手，而是接纳所有人。正是通过这种非结构化和非计划化的方式，社区随着时间的推移而发展。与职场不同，开源社区没有想通的机制建立共享文化。社区成员可能与为竞争对手工作的人一起工作，可能来自不同的文化背景，并且可能有意愿一起合作。开源社区可能缺少领导机制来监管行为和解决冲突。正如 Verizon Media 的开源高级总监 Gil Yehuda 解释的那样，“开源项目往往更看重技术技能，而非领导或者管理技能。当项目出现冲突时，项目领导者们可能不知道如何有效地解决在线冲突”。Comcast的开源实践高级总监、Linux 基金会董事会成员 Nithya Ruff 也表示同意，“因此，期望他们成为优秀的领导者是不公平的。在某些情况下，可能需要将他们与知识和最佳实践相结合。在其他情况下，可能意味着需要确保项目既有技术领导，又有能够将这些技能带到项目中的社区领导。我们需要在讨论中提出问题选择，以便让维护者做出正确的选择”。

In an open source community, interactions often occur electronically, and usually in English,  through mediums such as text messages on GitHub issues, Slack conversations and email threads, or in person at technology conferences. Underrepresented individuals  may face a language barrier, feel insecure interacting in a non-native language, miss out on culturally informed idioms, have an unreliable internet connection, lack the resources to travel to open source conferences, and as a result, miss these opportunities to communicate and connect with other community members in the same way that those with greater access do. On the other side, people already participating in these communities may not perceive this communication inclusivity issue, and even more enforcing undesired situations with the use of jargon or subjective references, and new members may feel uncomfortable publicly asking for a clarification or specific meanings.

在开源社区中，互动通常以电子的方式发生，而且通常是英语，通过例如 GitHub 问题上的文本消息、Slack 对话和电子邮件等媒介，或者实在技术交流会上面对面交流。来自少数群体的个人可能面临语言障碍，在使用非母语交流时会感到不安，错过文化相关的惯用语，拥有不可靠的网络连接，缺乏参与开源会议的资源，因此错失了与其他社区成员以相同方式交流和联系的机会。另一方面，已经参与这些社区的人可能没有意识到这种交流包容性问题，甚至会因为使用术语和主观引用而加剧这种不良情况，新成员可能会因为公开要求澄清或者询问具体含义而感到不舒服。

This lower representation in technology overall points to a shortage of talent overall, and in turn, to a limitation in attracting new contributors into open source communities. Talent shortages slow innovation and up the ante between open source communities competing for the available talent. It also hamstrings corporate contributors who are desperately seeking to add open source talent to their own rosters too.

技术领域总体人才比例较低表明人才总体不足，进而限制了新贡献者加入开源社区。人才短缺会缓慢创新，并且家具开源社区之间争夺可用人才的竞争。它也束缚了那些迫切寻求将开源人才加入他们名单的企业贡献者。

According to a Linux Foundation’s [Open Source Jobs Report](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/2018/06/open-source-jobs-report-2018/), "87% of hiring managers report difficulty finding open source talent, and nearly half (48%) report their organizations have begun to support open source projects with code or other resources for the explicit reason of recruiting individuals with those software skills." 

根据 Linux 基金会的[开源工作报告](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/2018/06/open-source-jobs-report-2018/)，“87% 的招聘经理反映很难找到开源人才，将近一半（48%）反映他们的组织已经开始使用代码或者其他资源支持开源项目，其明确目的就是招募拥有这些软件技能的人才。”

Open source communities come under risk if the pool of contributors and maintainers is not maintained at healthy levels which can lead to [open source burnout](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/burnout-open-source-communities).

如果贡献者和维护者的数量没有保持在健康的水平，开源社区将面临风险，这可能会导致[开源倦怠](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/burnout-open-source-communities)。

> "I'm concerned about the fact that a lot of our projects are going to be very under-resourced. Many projects that a lot of us care about have one or two developers only, and a lot of us are becoming older and gray haired," said [Nithya Ruff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nithyaruff/), senior director, Open Source Practice at Comcast and a member of the Board of Directors at The Linux Foundation. “As we age, I'm concerned that, in our passing on the knowledge or expanding the contributor community and key projects such that we can sustain those projects, and the only way we can change that is if we open the doors and we do apprenticeships and mentorships and we actually pass the knowledge on and teach people and not just stay with, ‘Ah, it's me, and it'll die when I leave.’" But there’s more at stake than talent pipelines, succession plans, and the success of open source communities. “The other concern is as newer and newer industries get involved in additional transformation and start using open source, it's as much about scaling and welcoming new industries into open source,” says Ruff. “Open source needs to evolve and change and embrace new industries and new people into this and be able to codify and share the culture with them and not just stay static.”

> “我关心的是，我们的很多项目都将面临着资源不足的情况。我们很多人关心的许多项目都只有一个或者两个开发人员，而我们中的很多人正在逐渐老去。”康卡斯特（Comcast）开源实践高级总监、Linux 基金会董事会成员[尼提亚·拉夫](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nithyaruff/)（Nithya Ruff）说道。“随着我们年龄的增长，我担心的是，在我们传播知识或扩大贡献者社区以及维持关键项目的可持续性方面会出现问题，而改变这种现状的唯一方法是敞开大门，开展学徒和导师制，真正的传播知识，教授他人，而不是停留在“啊哈，这只有我能做，我离开后他就会消亡””。但这不仅仅是人才梯队、继任计划以及开源社区的成功。“另一个担忧是，随着越来越多新兴行业参与到转型过程中并开始使用开源，这同样需要扩大开源规模并且欢迎新的行业加入开源，”拉夫（Ruff）表示。“开源需要不断演进、改变和拥抱新的产业和新人，并能够与他们指定和共享文化，而不是停滞不前。”

The following tips and guidelines are aimed to help increase the levels of diversity and inclusion within open source communities, with the recognition that each community’s culture is unique. We recognize this is a shared journey, and additional input is always welcomed.

### Using a Data-driven Approach
### 使用数据驱动的方法

As management consultant Peter Drucker put it: "If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it." Metrics provide us with insights and best practices to help us succeed—and adjust where needed. This is true in diversity and inclusion efforts as well. Data can help guide us as we strive to increase the levels of diversity and inclusion within our open source communities.

正如管理顾问彼得·德鲁克（Peter Drucker）所说：“如果你不能衡量它，你就不能提升它。”指标为我们提供了见解和最佳实践，帮助我们取得成功，以及必要时进行调整。当我们努力提升开源社区的多元化和包容性水平时，数据可以提供帮助指导。

You may want to start by determining specific community D&I goals from the outset and then measuring your community’s progress against those goals.

您可能需要在一开始时，确定具体的社区多元性和包容性（D&I）目标，然后再根据这些目标衡量社区的进展情况。

For tips and best practices, the [CHAOSS Project’s Diversity & Inclusion Working Group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion), a group strongly rooted in [Mozilla research](https://opensource.com/article/17/9/diversity-and-inclusion-innovation) is a great starting point. This group aims at [bringing together experiences](https://thenewstack.io/how-chaoss-di-can-help-diversity-in-the-open-source-community/) with measuring diversity and inclusion consistently across open source communities , as was done in the [OpenStack Gender Diversity Report](http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/bitergia-intel-report/), and advancing best practices. The group has compiled [dimensions of diversity and inclusion](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/demographic-data) that can be used across seven [focus areas of metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion#metrics-focus-areas), and uses a [goal-question-metric approach](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/mvz/handouts/gqm.pdf) to guide the development of metrics. The diversity and inclusion focus areas include:

对于建议和最佳实践，[CHAOSS 项目的多元化和包容性工作组（CHAOSS Project’s Diversity & Inclusion Working Group）](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion)是一个绝佳的起点，该组深深植根于 [Mozilla 研究](https://opensource.com/article/17/9/diversity-and-inclusion-innovation)之上。该工作组旨在汇聚开源社区中一致衡量多元化和包容性的[经验](https://thenewstack.io/how-chaoss-di-can-help-diversity-in-the-open-source-community/)，正如在 [OpenStack 性别多样性报告](http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/bitergia-intel-report/)所做的那样，并推动最佳实践发展。该工作组已经汇编了[多样性和包容性的维度](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/demographic-data)，这些维度可以在七个[指标的关键领域](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion#metrics-focus-areas)中应用，并使用[目标-问题-指标方法](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/mvz/handouts/gqm.pdf)来指导指标的发展。多元化和多样性关键领域包括：

* Event Diversity: How well are events set up to include diverse people? 
* 活动多元化：活动的设置是否有利于吸引多元化的人群参与？

* Contributions: What is the diversity of the contributions within a community, and how are these different contributions valued?
* 贡献：社区内贡献的多元化怎么样，以及这些不同的贡献是如何被评价的？

* Communication Inclusivity: How diverse and inclusive is the communication among existing and potential contributors?
* 沟通的包容性：现有的和潜在的贡献者之间沟通的多元化和包容性是怎样的？

* Recognition of Good Work: How is ‘good work’ recognized and rewarded in a way that is inclusive? 
* 对优秀工作的认可：如何以包容性的方式认可和奖励“优秀工作”。

* Leadership: Is leadership appropriately designed for inclusion, and how well is the group functioning? 
* 领导力：领导层是否适当的为包容性进行了设计，以及团队是如何运作的？

* Governance: How well are components of governance setup to enforce standards for inclusion? 
* 治理：治理的各个组成部分在执行包容性标准方面的效果如何？

* Project and Community: How well are interfaces for community engagement, like project repositories and community design, setup for diverse people, perspectives and goals?
* 项目和社区：项目仓库和社区设计等社区参与界面，在为多样化人群、观点和目标设置方面，做得如何？

You can also look to other open source communities for inspiration.

你还可以从其他开源社区中寻求灵感。

> "People across the TODO group membership are doing some really amazing things in terms of how they demonstrate support for inclusion in their projects as well as in their Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) and in how they interact with the community," said Nithya Ruff.  “Perhaps capturing those best practices across the communities and aggregating and curating may be a good approach to take. One example is diversity scholarship sponsorships. A lot of us build healthy objectives into our own projects and sponsor events that are around diversity, so that's one approach that would be good to take.”

>  Nithya Ruff 表示，“TODO 小组的成员们在他们的项目中、开源办公室（OSPOs）以及他们与社区的互动中，都在以令人惊叹的方式展示着对包容性的支持。”“也许将这些社区的最佳实践进行汇总和整理会是一个不错的方法。一个例子就是设定多元化奖学金赞助。我们中的很多人都在我们的项目中设定了健康的目标，并赞助与多样性相关的活动，因此，这会是一个值得采纳的方法。”

Some good examples of diversity data reports exist and you can use those as templates for what data to look for and measure. You might want to start reviewing those listed on [Open Diversity Data](http://opendiversitydata.org/).

已经存在一些多元化数据报告的优秀样例，你可以以这些样例作为模板来了解需要查和衡量需要哪些数据。你可以从查阅[ Open Diversity Data](http://opendiversitydata.org/) 列出的样例开始。

Beware of relying on "vanity metrics" that can make a community appear healthier than it really is. Vanity metrics skew results most often by measuring a less diverse group with another group that is more diverse to artificially inflate diversity numbers of the first group. An example in the corporate world would be to measure diversity by the numbers in the entire engineering department, which contains engineers and administrative assistants, rather than measuring diversity solely within the engineering job title.

当心依赖于“虚荣指标”，它们会让社区看起来比实际更加多元化。虚荣指标通常通过将一个多元化较低的人群与一个多元化较高的人群进行比较来扭曲结果，从而人为地夸大第一个群体的多元化数字。企业领域的例子就是用整个工程部门的人数来衡量多样性，该部门既包含工程师也包含行政助理，而不是仅仅衡量工程师职位的内部多样性。

To help avoid accidental vanity measurements and get the true measure of progress, consider the following guidelines listed on the [ProjectInclude.org website](http://projectinclude.org/measuring_progress#existing-diversity-data-reports).

为避免出现意外的虚荣度量，并且获得真正的进展度量标准，可以参考以下列举在[ ProjectInclude.org](http://projectinclude.org/measuring_progress#existing-diversity-data-reports) 网站的指南。

### Inclusion: Retaining Diverse Contributors
### 包容性：保留多元化的贡献者

While diversity focuses on bringing underrepresented people into a community, inclusion is about making people feel welcome and supported within that community. Building inclusive communities is a good first step to ensure that all contributors can participate to their fullest potential within a community. Without an inclusive community, you risk diverse contributors not participating for long, and leaving your community for others that are more welcoming and appreciative of their contributions. 

尽管多元化注重于将代表性不足的人群吸纳进社区，包容性则是让人们在社区内感到受欢迎和得到支持。建立包容性的社区是确保所有贡献者能在社区内充分发挥潜力的良好第一步。如果没有包容性的社区，你将面临多元化的贡献者不会长期参与，以及离开你的社区，转而投向那些更欢迎和欣赏他们贡献的其他社区的风险。

Possible solutions all stem from one goal succinctly stated by the Node.js Inclusivity Working Group in the [code of conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md): "Increasing inclusivity means making the project a safe and friendly place for people from diverse backgrounds."

可能的解决方案都源于 Node.js 包容性工作组在[行为准则](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)中简明扼要地提出的一个目标：“提高包容性意味着让项目成为来自不同背景的人们的安全友好之地。”

The most successful approaches to making the community safe and friendly are sustained efforts. Approaches initiated and maintained consistently work more effectively than sporadic efforts with little follow-through. It is also important to guard against waning commitment after the initial rush of enthusiasm.

使社区变得安全和友好的最成功方法是持续的努力。从一开始就持续不断地努力的方法比偶尔且没有后续跟进的努力更有效果。还需要警惕在最初的热情消退后，承诺的减弱。

The important thing—whether in beginning to build an inclusive community or in improving one—is that the intent be obviously authentic and sincere rather than begrudging and shallow. While the goal is to build-in inclusiveness to the degree that it becomes an ingrained norm, this does not happen by accident. It takes substantial effort to build a community where all feel secure and openness is ubiquitous.

无论是开始建设一个包容性的社区，还是改善已有社区，其重要之处在于，其意图必须明显表现出真诚而非勉强和肤浅。虽然目标是建立包容性到成为根深蒂固的规范程度，但这并非偶然。要建立一个所有人都感到安全和开放无处不在的社区，需要付出大量的努力。

Here are recommendations to build and maintain inclusiveness:

这里有一些关于建设和维持包容性的建议：

**Make it easy to contribute.** Some great starting points for newcomers include documentation and tutorials—they help bring newcomers up to speed quickly and participate in a way that fits more smoothly with the group. Small, defined tasks both clarify project needs and broaden the number of people contributing to filling those needs. These tasks could be marked as "good-first-issue" for discoverability and more experienced community members should be prepared to leave the tasks open while being ready to mentor anyone who attempts them.

**使贡献变得容易。** 对新人来说，一些好的起点包括文献和教程——它们能帮助新人迅速提升能力，并以一种更平滑的方式参与小组。一些明确且较小规模的任务既可以明确项目的需求，又可以扩大参与满足这些需求的人数。这些任务可以标记为“适合初学者的好问题”，以便于发现，同时，经验丰富的社区成员应当准备好保持这些任务开放，同时准备好指导任何尝试它们的人。

**Recognize all contributions.** While code is the center of any community, it’s not the only necessary task. "You can attract a more diverse set of perspectives and opinions when you count contributions that are not just code," says [Guy Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guywmartin/), director at Open@ADSK (Autodesk). “When you count answering questions, when you count contributing documentation, when you count people who are working on outreach, people working on design and technical writing for the documentation—these are ways to widen the scope of what you're looking at in terms of what's a contribution.” The challenge is recognizing contributions that are not logged in collaboration tools (e.g., code repositories, mailing lists, forums) such as community management, event organizing, marketing, and outreach.

**承认所有贡献。** 尽管代码是任何社区的中心，但并不是唯一必要的任务。Open@ADSK（Autodesk）的总监 [Guy Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guywmartin/) 表示：“当你不仅统计代码方面的贡献时，你就可以吸引更多不同观点和意见的人。”“当你计算回答问题、贡献文档、进行对外联络、从事文档的设计和技术写作等工作的次数时，你就能扩大你眼中贡献的范畴。”挑战在于认可那些没有在协作工具（例如代码库、邮件列表、论坛）中记录的贡献，比如社区管理、活动组织、市场营销和对外联络等。

**Create an accepting culture.** While it is important to have common goals in the community, conformity in thinking is the antithesis of creativity and innovation. But, speaking out and offering new ideas can be nerve-wracking for anyone. You can [create a welcoming culture](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) where new ideas and new ways of thinking or doing things is accepted, whether it is coming from an established community member or a newcomer, using these principles:

**营造包容的文化氛围。** 尽管在社区中拥有共同的目标很重要，但是思维上的一致性是创造力和创新性的反面。然而，对于任何人来说，发表观点，提出新想法都可能是令人紧张的。你可以通过以下原则来[营造欢迎文化](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)，让新想法和新的思维方式以及做事方法都能被接受，无论他们是资深社区成员还是新手。

**Welcome newcomers.** Make a point for community leaders and members to reach out and welcome newcomers as soon as they arrive.

**欢迎新人。** 让社区领导和成员引起重视，在新成员一到就主动与他们联系，表示欢迎。

**Set expectations**. Make it known how members are expected to receive and treat newcomers. Also set expectations on accepting more contributions and ideas from existing members who may have previously been discouraged from participating.

**设定期望。** 明确成员们应当如何接待新成员。同时，也要设定期望，让之前因受打击而未积极参与的现有成员能够接受更多的贡献和想法。

**Don’t accept bad behavior and speak out when it happens.** Make bullying, name calling, stereotyping, humiliation and other negative behavior taboo in the community. When these behaviors are unwelcome, individuals will have to communicate with more thought and sensitivity. And really, it’s just asking everyone to act civilly as they would anywhere else. Modeling tactful behavior in calling out bad behaviors also helps resolve issues.  

**不接受不良行为，发生时要大胆说出。**在社区中，应当禁止欺凌，侮辱，刻板印象、羞辱和其他负面行为。当这些行为是不受欢迎的，人们将不得不更加周到和敏感的方式进行交流。事实上，这只是要求每个人像在其他任何地方一样，表现得有礼貌。以巧妙的方式指出不良行为也将有助于解决问题。

**Listen.** Accepting begins with listening and so does issue resolution. Sometimes misunderstandings happen, especially where language and cultural differences exist. It’s important to sort these out before anyone reacts to anything. Active listening also means listen to everyone with an open mind. Don’t discount ideas or complaints – or accept excuses -- out of hand. Look into issues and search for solutions. Then look again for ways to ensure the environment isn’t fostering such behaviors elsewhere in the community.

**倾听。** 接纳始于倾听，问题解决也是。有时误解会发生，尤其是语言和文化差异存在。在任何人对任何事做出回应前，整理这些非常重要。积极倾听也意味着以开放的心态倾听每个人的意见。不要轻易否定想法或投诉，也不要轻易接受借口。要正视问题并且搜寻解决方案。然后再次寻找方法，确保社区其他地方的环境下不会助长此类行为。

**Be kind.** Even old timers in the community will feel more relaxed and respected when kindness prevails. Newcomers will feel even more so. However, inclusiveness is more than just good manners. People can still be mistreated without voices being raised or threats made directly. You can combat this with sustained and expressed emphasis on kindness and professional courtesies. 

**要友善。**当友善成为主流时，即使是社区中的老成员也将感到更加轻松和受到尊重。新成员更是如此。然而，包容性不仅仅是礼貌问题。即使没有提高嗓门或者直接发出威胁，人们仍然可能会受到不公正对待。你可以通过持续强调友善和专业礼仪来应对这一问题。

**Adopt a code of conduct and enforce it**. In reality, bad behavior does happen in open source communities, whether or not it is intentional. Situations can get heated and communications may fall short of professional standards. Small acts of misconduct can easily escalate in an online community and harm project participants or [the project itself](http://writing.jan.io/2015/11/20/sustainable-open-source.html). A Code of Conduct (CoC) is a social contract that encourages good behavior and discourages bad behavior in a community. A CoC helps address these issues and how they are to be resolved. It isn’t always easy to get all members of a community to accept a CoC, but it’s almost impossible to take steps to make and maintain a healthy, diverse and inclusive community without a CoC that can be, and is, enforced. Here is [a good template](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) to use, along with a great [blog](https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/how-were-making-code-of-conduct-enforcement-real-and-scaling-it-3e382cf94415) describing an example of an enforcement workflow.

**制定行为准则并且执行它。**事实上，不良行为确实在开源社区中发生，无论是否故意。情况可能会变得紧张，沟通可能达不到专业标准。在线社区中，轻微的不当行为很容易升级，并且伤害项目的参与者们或者[项目本身](http://writing.jan.io/2015/11/20/sustainable-open-source.html)。行为准则（CoC）是社区中的一种社会契约，它鼓励良好的行为并阻止不良行为。行为准则有助于解决这些问题，并指出如何解决这些问题。尽管让社区的所有成员接受行为准则并不容易，但如果没有可以执行且确实执行的行为准则，几乎不可能采取措施建立和维护一个健康、多元化和包容性的社区。这里有一个[好的模板](http://writing.jan.io/2015/11/20/sustainable-open-source.html)可供使用，还有一篇精彩的[博客](https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/how-were-making-code-of-conduct-enforcement-real-and-scaling-it-3e382cf94415)描述了一个执行工作流程的例子。

A CoC addresses these types of issues:
行为准则解决以下几类问题：

* when people disagree about a very contentious issue
* 当人们在一个非常有争议的问题上存在分歧

* when someone checks in code that breaks an important feature
* 当有人提交的代码破坏了重要功能时

* when people join a project midstream and lack context about an old issue
* 当人们在中途加入项目，并且缺乏对老问题的背景了解时

* when people are unclear in their communication style
* 当人们对他们的交流风格不清楚时

* when language and culture cause people to misunderstand
* 当语言和文化导致人们产生误解时

* when someone feels the need to leave the community
* 当有人感觉需要离开社区时

* when insults, threatening words or unwanted sexual attention occurs
* 当出现侮辱、威胁性语言或者不受欢迎的性注意时

"Some people think the Code of Conduct is there to weed out people or to police online behaviors," says [Gil Yehuda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilyehuda/), senior director of Open Source at Verizon Media. “I think Codes of Conduct are more method for reminding all people to act with respect, even when things are stressing the community. A project leader can point to the code before something unravels into a fight, and that’s better than waiting for a complaint to be issued.”

Verizon Media 的开源部门的高级主管 [Gil Yehuda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilyehuda/)表示：“有些人认为行为准则就是为了淘汰人或者监管在线行为，”。“我认为行为准则更多的是一种提醒所有人保持尊重的方法，即便是在社区压力重重的时候。项目负责人可以在事情演变成争吵之前引用该准则，这总比等着投诉来得更好。”

It’s also wise to have an escalation path, or workflow, in place beforehand so that you’re prepared to enforce the Code of Conduct. Additionally, being clear on who is involved in [decisions](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/blob/00f56b3c9c182a23a070e2bc523dcad6896bb34b/code-of-conduct-enforcement/investigation/working-group/role-groups.md) on that pathway will save time, and reduce complexity. With an escalation path and decision-making framework in place, problems can be addressed quickly and uniformly without generating disruptive chaos. "We can't prevent harassment or abuse from happening, but we can enforce the consequences and protect the community from a downward spiral," says Gil Yehuda. “A prepared workflow means we can react quickly when there's a report. We’ll then run a review process offline, and report back to the community indicating there was an issue, and that we request that the issue is not discussed on the community forum,” Yehuda explained.



**5. Consider ways to make your project more accessible.** Focus on enabling internationalization within your projects. Specifically, take steps to break the language barrier, which will improve D&I contributions. Make all your documentation, tools, and official communication channels fully accessible to people with disabilities. The effect on your community will be very similar to breaking the language barrier. Improving the contributing experience for the most difficult cases improves the experience for everyone. A few ‘small start’ suggestions may include providing transcriptions and/or subtitles if you use YouTube, translating documentation into multiple languages, and live streaming your events. To put focus on these inclusion issues and formalize their status, a community may adopt [a tag for inclusion bugs](https://medium.com/@sunnydeveloper/squash-inclusion-bugs-982a3e5ee29d).

### Attracting Diverse Contributors

When you’re ready to turn your attention to recruiting diverse contributors into your open source community, here are some guidelines to get you started.

**1. Set goals and measure against them.** You have to know what you’re aiming for if you’re ever going to hit the target. Name your goals and put tracking and metrics in place so you can manage your progress. As noted earlier, the CHAOSS Project’s Diversity & Inclusion Working Group can be a useful resource.

**2. Include goals for diversity in project documentation**. But don’t stop there. Communicate goals and actions to the community and ask them to assist.

**3. Create a working group to proactively broaden the project’s appeal.** A good example of such a group is [The Node.js Inclusivity Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity), which "exists to improve inclusivity and diversity in the Node.js project and surrounding community." Another great example is the [OpenStack Diversity Working Group.](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Diversity)

**4. Set diversity and inclusion goals/initiatives for events.** Work your networks to identify and invite individuals to your event as speakers and panelists who fit your diversity goals. Recruit advisors from diverse backgrounds to help you communicate in a way that speaks to the people you have the hardest time attracting to your event. Communicate diversity and inclusion expectations from the first call for participation to the closing remarks at the event. Check out this [30-minute presentation by Christopher Neugebauer, Josh Simmons, Sam Kitajima-Kimbrel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ZhMnfUKIA) as an inspiration to running an inclusion-first event.

**5. Connect with other community managers to share best practices/ ideas.** The bigger open source community is your community too. Reach out to other community managers to learn what they’ve done that has worked, and to [share your own ideas and experiences in D&I](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/diversity--inclusion-in-open-source).

**6. Be proactive about reaching outside of your network.** You might consider supporting existing efforts or creating new groups outside your network that people from other networks can join in too.

**7. Request that project leadership attend diversity training**. Diversity training is different than sensitivity training. Sensitivity training is centered on awareness of one’s own prejudices and the sensitivity of others. Diversity and inclusion training "focuses on providing the knowledge, skills, and tools for working with diverse teams to enhance performance and impact the bottom line. This type of training is a key component of a diversity and inclusion plan,"[according to](https://www.kparksconsulting.com/tips-moving-sensitivity-training-to-inclusion-business/) K. Parks Consulting. This type of training will better equip you for the quest ahead. For example, the CNCF requires all of its community event speakers to attend [inclusive speaker orientation training](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-speaker-orientation/).

### Other Recommendations

Research and information abounds to spark ideas and guide your progress. And you are not alone in this quest—many others are working on improving their communities too and are open to sharing and exchanging ideas. Further, the number of established programs you can join and support are growing every day. The fruits of those efforts will benefit the open source community at large, as well as your community. Here are a few other programs and steps that you might want to consider:

* Participate in internship programs to grow diversity, such as [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) or run your own, e.g., through [CommunityBridge](https://communitybridge.org/).

* Provide transparency reports around D&I. The "Gender Diversity in the OpenStack Community" [report](https://superuser.openstack.org/articles/2018-gender-diversity-report/) is one good example.

* Offer travel and training scholarships for project related events. Many foundations offer diversity scholarships and travel programs, including the Linux Foundation, Cloud Native Computing Foundation and OpenStack Foundation.

* Start proactively outreaching for diverse speakers. To get you started, here’s [a list of female tech speakers and organizers](https://github.com/fempire/women-tech-speakers-organizers) on GitHub. Another connection to find women speakers is @CallbackWomen, a Twitter account for women who are tech speakers.

All of the above are the lessons learned and insights gained so far. No doubt there will be many more. Feel free to add your thoughts, ideas, lists and programs as well.
